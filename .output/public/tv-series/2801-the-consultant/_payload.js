Over time, Patoff gains more power, to the point where he seems to be running the whole company. He enacts arbitrary and invasive changes to office protocol. He places cameras all over the building, making workers paranoid; he calls employees at all hours of the night, visits some of their homes and menaces their families. People who defy the consultant get fired... or worse. They soon realize they're not just fighting for their jobs: They're fighting for their lives.The Consultant is a biting workplace satire, with the horrific touches only Bentley Little could provide.",thumbnail:"http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wK9qzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:e}},{id:13325,attributes:{title:"University",description:"Reluctantly returning for another semester at UC, campus editor Jim Parker and library assistant Faith Pullen are alarmed by a series of bloody accidents that seem to be linked to an eerie and sinister force.",thumbnail:"http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pQKongEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2017-09-18",publisher:e,subtitle:e}},{id:13326,attributes:{title:"Walking Alone",description:"From the mind of the man Stephen King calls \"a master of the macabre\" comes a brilliant new collection of no-punches-pulled horror stories, some never-before-collected and many originals that have never been published anywhere before.In \"Sticky Note,\" Gary finds a note with two simple words on it in the gutter: Kill her. Was it part of someone's to-do list? Bentley Little tells us where this yellow square piece of paper takes Gary in a way that only he can.A bad confrontation with a maid at a fancy resort leads a couple on a chilling journey they never dreamed would happen. \"The Maid\" may make you think twice about asking the front desk for extra towels or complaining about anything ever again.You'll never think of small-town rodeos the same way after reading \"The Last Rodeo on the Circuit,\" and neither will Rob and Teena after they decide to take in the local bizarre entertainment in an unscheduled stop along their road trip to Vegas.Would you anonymously write your negative thoughts about your friends in a slam book? What if the words you wrote changed things? \"Slam Dance\" shows you what the consequences of that might be.Sometimes, a \"Palm Reader\" knows more than they're willing to reveal to their customers, chilling things that their clients don't really want to know. Would you tell them anyway?Snowmen aren't scary, right? Hal and April Katz are out on a wintery drive when they see a snowman on the side of the road. Then another that looks almost the same a few miles later. And then, hundreds of snowmen around the next bend. You might think snowmen aren't scary, but \"Snow\" will prove you dead wrong.Bentley Little can take the innocuous, twist it around, and write a story that will change your way of thinking. Walking Alone: Short Stories is a shining example of his talent to scare you, creep you out, and make you shudder.Table of Contents: Milk Ranch PointSnowChildren's HospitalPalm ReaderSlam DanceLast Rodeo on the CircuitThe Car WashThe FeebThe MallHuntingThe Piano Player has no FingersThe Man Who Watched CartoonsApt PunishmentBlack FridayMoNA Retrospective, Los AngelesJorgensen's FenceThe Silence of TreesSticky NoteThe Smell of Overripe LoquatsThe MaidSchoolgirlsUnder Midwest SkiesPictures of HuxleyMy College Admission EssayPool, Air Conditioning, Free HBOThe TrainA Random Thought from God's Day",thumbnail:"http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2eZqzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:"Short Stories"}},{id:13327,attributes:{title:"Dark Screams: Volume Five",description:"Mick Garris, J. Kenner, Kealan Patrick Burke, Del James, and Bentley Little pry open a sarcophagus of horror and dread in Dark Screams: Volume Five, from Brian James Freeman and Richard Chizmar of the esteemed Cemetery Dance Publications. EVERYTHING YOU’VE ALWAYS WANTED by Mick Garris It was supposed to be the night of his life: a celebration of his one hit slasher flick. But the price of admission is higher than this has-been filmmaker ever could have imagined. THE ONE AND ONLY by J. Kenner When he was seven, Will Underwood’s nanny told him she had the Sight. Years later, a broken heart sends him to New Orleans . . . but it’s fate that leads him to Madame Darkling’s Voodoo Emporium. THE LAND OF SUNSHINE by Kealan Patrick Burke Although she was mute long before the affair that nearly wrecked their marriage, her silence has tortured her husband ever since. Now he will seek out what he has lost—or be driven mad by remorse. MECHANICAL GRATITUDE by Del James Arnold loves his ’68 Camaro almost as much as he loves his wife, and he’s willing to do anything to protect them both—especially after hearing strange noises coming from his garage. THE PLAYHOUSE by Bentley Little A real-estate agent is drawn into a children’s playhouse behind an abandoned property she’s trying to sell—and finds herself strangely reluctant to leave. Praise for Dark Screams: Volume Five “Freeman and Chizmar’s fifth horror anthology runs the gamut from throwback horror to lyrical and heartbreaking tales. . . . This collection will satisfy.”—Publishers Weekly “A horror fan’s dream . . . As with the rest of the series, fans of the genre should not hesitate to pick this one up.”—Examiner “You can discover new authors and rediscover old ones, and that’s always a good thing in my book.

WALPUSKI’S TYPEWRITER by Frank Darabont They say that genius is ten percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration. For Howard Walpuski, it’s an IBM Selectric II typewriter, a nefarious secret, and a whole lot of blood. THE BOY by Bentley Little Christine has found the perfect neighborhood to raise her family: a quaint, quiet, friendly place where everyone gets along. Everyone, that is, except for the boy. TUMOR by Benjamin Percy He dodged death in the nick of time when the golf ball-sized tumor was surgically removed from his head. But the tumor isn’t done with him. TWISTED AND GNARLED by Billie Sue Mosiman He’s smart. Smarter than anyone knows. No one has linked him to the string of bodies he’s left up and down the California coast. Only one woman has ever come close—and she’s no match for his intellect. THE PALAVER by Kealan Patrick Burke It’s time for Oscar Dennihy to close his failing barber shop and retire—until a mysterious customer tells him a truly hair-raising tale . . . and gives Oscar a wonderful and terrible new purpose. INDIA BLUE by Glen Hirshberg Like most Americans, Enrico never gave much thought to the sport of cricket. Not until America’s Rockin’ Professional Cricket game—a spectacle that will live forever in his most horrible nightmares.
