I have waited all these years for you to come back to this town. England, 1940: Britain is entrenched in war with the Germans when young Jago is evacuated from the Blitz bombings in London to the Yorkshire coast. With just the memory of his dead mother for comfort, Jago is desperate only to survive the war in some peace. But arriving at the hostile Streonshalgh Manor in the town of Whitby, he is confronted with cruel and frenzied locals, seemingly possessed by ancient stories of clannish retribution and sadistic horrors. The RedEye comet hovers fatefully over the town; people are being viciously killed; and Jago's nights are spent as waking nightmares, darting through bloodstained and murderous streets. As shades of his past come rushing back to haunt him, Jago must confront the truth of this town - the perilous and violent truth of the ancient Vampyres.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DIZRKrcwwWUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:f,published:"2010-10-07",publisher:b,subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377167295}}("G.P.
