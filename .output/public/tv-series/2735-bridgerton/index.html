A moment so tremendous, so sharp and breath-taking, that one knows one&#39;s life will never be the same. For Michael Stirling, London&#39;s most infamous bachelor, that moment came the first time he laid eyes on Francesca Bridgerton. After a lifetime of chasing women, of smiling slyly as they chased him, of allowing himself to be caught but never permitting his heart to become engaged, he took one look at Francesca Bridgerton and fell so fast and hard into love it was a wonder he managed to remain standing. Unfortunately for Michael, however, Francesca&#39;s surname was to remain Bridgerton for only a mere thirty-six hours longer - the occasion of their meeting was, lamentably, a supper celebrating her imminent wedding to his cousin.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb13021"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-yellow"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKa8cmtufJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Bridgertons: Happily Ever After" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Bridgertons: Happily Ever After</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Julia Quinn<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Harper Collins</span><span><span> - </span>4/2/2013</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Julia Quinn presents a novella featuring Violet Bridgerton along with a collection of “second epilogues” to her Bridgerton series—her beloved Regency-set novels featuring her charming, powerful Bridgerton family—now a series created by Shondaland for Netflix.

This is not one of those times. Everyone expects Billie Bridgerton to marry one of the Rokesby brothers. The two families have been neighbors for centuries, and as a child the tomboyish Billie ran wild with Edward and Andrew. Either one would make a perfect husband... someday. Sometimes you fall in love with exactly the person you think you should... Or not. There is only one Rokesby Billie absolutely cannot tolerate, and that is George. He may be the eldest and heir to the earldom, but he&#39;s arrogant, annoying, and she&#39;s absolutely certain he detests her. Which is perfectly convenient, as she can&#39;t stand the sight of him, either. But sometimes fate has a wicked sense of humor... Because when Billie and George are quite literally thrown together, a whole new sort of sparks begins to fly. And when these lifelong adversaries finally kiss, they just might discover that the one person they can&#39;t abide is the one person they can&#39;t live without...</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb13023"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-yellow"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bqu4zQEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Bridgerton [TV Tie-In]" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Bridgerton [TV Tie-In]</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Julia Quinn<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Avon Books</span><span><span> - </span>12/1/2020</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>From New York Times bestselling author Julia Quinn comes the first novel in the beloved Regency-set world of her charming, powerful Bridgerton family, now a series created by Shonda Rhimes for Netflix. In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince--while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable...but not too amiable. Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen. Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society--just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend&#39;s sister offers another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar. The plan works like a charm--at first. But amid the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat world of London&#39;s elite, there is only one certainty: love ignores every rule... This novel includes the 2nd epilogue, a peek at the story after the story.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk4MDdhODctMmFhYi00ZTNhLThlN2UtN2NhZGY0OGFlMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Bridgerton" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the series Bridgerton is based on the book The Duke And I? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">From Shondaland and Creator Chris Van Dusen, the first season of Bridgerton follows Daphne Bridgerton (Pheobe Dynevor), the eldest daughter of the powerful Bridgerton family as she makes her debut onto Regency London&#39;s competitive marriage market. Hoping to follow in her parent&#39;s footsteps and find a match sparked by true love, Daphne&#39;s prospects initially seem to be unrivaled. But as her older brother (Jonathan Bailey) begins to rule out her potential suitors, the high society scandal sheet written by the mysterious Lady Whistledown (Julie Andrews) casts aspersions on Daphne. Enter the highly desirable and rebellious Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page), committed bachelor and the catch of the season for the debutantes&#39; mamas. Despite proclaiming that they want nothing the other has to offer, their attraction is undeniable and sparks fly as they find themselves engaged in an increasing battle of wits while navigating society&#39;s expectations for their future.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-yellow font-semibold">7.3/10</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about The Duke And I, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
