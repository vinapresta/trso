But it can be pretty great, too: you've had the hottest sex of your life, you get that plum job, you muster the courage to write your novel. Everyday across the world, people go through the full and glorious gamut of life - but sometimes, a little advice is needed. For several years, thousands turned to Cheryl Strayed, a then-anonymous internet Agony Aunt. But unlike most Agony Aunts, this one's advice was spun from genuine compassion and informed by a wealth of personal experience - experience that was sometimes tragic and sometimes tender, often hilarious and often heartbreaking. Having successfully battled her own demons while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed sat down to answer the letters of the frightened, the anxious, the confused; and with each gem-like correspondence - of which the best are collected in this volume - she proved to be the perfect guide for those who had got a little lost in life.",thumbnail:"http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SRpcSNq-P4oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2013-03-15",publisher:"Atlantic Books Ltd",subtitle:"A Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick soon to be a major series on Disney+"}},{id:13317,attributes:{title:"Tiny Beautiful Things (10th Anniversary Edition)",description:"An anniversary edition of the bestselling collection of \"Dear Sugar\" advice columns written by the author of #1 New York Times bestseller Wild—featuring a new preface and six additional columns.

At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State—and she would do it alone. Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.",thumbnail:"http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OSUayFddVccC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2012-03-20",publisher:g,subtitle:"From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531234834}}("movie","series","Cheryl Strayed",true,"Tiny Beautiful Things",1,"Vintage","Advice from Dear Sugar"))
