Sometimes we have dreams of becoming the people we see in the media who seem like paragons of success or gods of the corporate world. Though ignorance may be bliss or what we do not know may not harm us directly, sometimes a small revelation into some issues and matters in the community or a nation goes a long way into adjusting our attitudes and sails of life. It may become a reference point to use in raising our children, and with the wisdom thereof, equip them with the truth so that they may also endeavour to come up with solutions when their time comes. As Michael Lewis writes, he hopes that college students trying to decide what to do with their lives might read it and decide that it&#39;s silly to phony it up, and abandon their passions or even their faint interests, to become financiers.&quot; He hoped that some bright kid at Ohio State University who really wanted to be an oceanographer would read his book, spurn the offer from Goldman Sachs, and set out to sea.Many things have taken place in the past, and others continue to occur even as you venture to consume this book in a jiffy. They said that knowledge and only the right kind of knowledge is power. Wisdom springs forth from the beginning of experience, and the knowledge of this experience makes the wisdom far greater than one can imagine. Michael Lewis&#39; book, The Big Short, comes with knowledge of historical events inside Wall Street. It comes bundled with real life experiences of business persons, companies, co-operations, organizations, and individuals. The book reveals what the world would have never known, or even heard. They seem like memoirs, memories of tycoons losing huge amounts of money, fraudsters taking advantage of the poor, and companies twisting their accounts for their own gain. Herein you find evil, crime, and tales of men who tried to fight the same with a weak yet formidable determination. Here Is A Preview Of What You&#39;ll Learn...

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry&#39;s beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry&#39;s information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett&#39;s prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old &quot;friend&quot;, retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">7.8/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">89%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">81/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine (movie tie-in), or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
