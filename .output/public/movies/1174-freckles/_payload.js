Freckles has lived all his life in a Chicago orphanage and has been missing his right hand as long as he can remember. Now an adult, he is hired on by the Grand Rapids lumber company to guard their valuable timber in the Limberlost Swamp. Freckles has lived his whole life in the city and is at first frightened and intimidated by this strange and wild place. Yet, he is eager to learn about his new home and he soon becomes enchanted by the beauty of the wildlife and plants in the swamp. Freckles also falls in love with a nameless young woman that he meets in the Limberlost and whom the reader knows only as \"The Swamp Angel\". Freckles is challenged by the mystery of his past and parentage and feels he is not worthy of love, but he proves himself to be an honorable and kind man. In this heart-warming and charming novel, Freckles finds his true home and learns the priceless value of courage and kindness.

One of the tests of good literature is whether it makes us think about important issues while enjoying the elements of the text, and Gene Stratton-Porter accomplishes just that in Freckles. Like \"A Girl of Limberlost,\" Freckles is a product of Stratton-Porter's own life and the times in which she lived. There were class differences in the early 1900's, and it was challenging for 'low-born' people to believe they could rise above that. They didn't have our modern-day notion of arrogance and independence. This is why Freckles has historical value in addition to its literary content and unique storylines. Freckles is a great role model for boys and girls alike, and is so humble! He will not let the \"Swamp Angel\" marry him, because he has only one hand, is an orphan, and has no knowledge of \"honorable birth\" which he thinks is very important. While it is true that the rich characters in Freckles looked down on others and that humble folk always respected the rich people, those were the attitudes and behavior of people in the times in which the book was written. In regards to Freckles always believing bad about himself, he did so because he had no way of knowing who he really was, so he assumed the worst--many people do that. This attitude is called \"determinism,\" which is basically the belief that people cannot rise above their background, heritage, circumstances, or physical conditions--that they are helpless to change their circumstances and lot in life. Determinism was a major concern in the works of many authors of Gene Stratton Porter's time period, who were seeking to challenge the set social classes and attitudes and forge new identities.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YtyhSgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2010-06-11",publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:6593,attributes:{title:"Gene Stratton-Porter Collection: A Girl of the Limberlost, Freckles, Laddie, The Harvester, A Daughter of the Land, At the Foot of the Rainbow, Her Fatther's Daughter, Michale O'Halloran",description:"Romances of the Land from Gene Stratton-Porter This collection includes: A Girl of the Limberlost Freckles The Harvester A Daughter of the Land At the Foot of the Rainbow Her Father's Daughter Laddie: A True Blue Story Michael O'Halloran",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ihJEDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2016-03-18",publisher:"Xist Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:6594,attributes:{title:"Freckles & a Girl of the Limberlost",description:"Freckles & A Girl of the Limberlost By Gene Stratton-Porter",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-_cloAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2014-06-04",publisher:h,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377325883}}("","Gene Stratton-Porter","movie",null,"Freckles","series",1,"CreateSpace"))
