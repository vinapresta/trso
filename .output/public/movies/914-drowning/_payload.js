Stephen, facing the almost simultaneous discovery that his wife is having an affair, returns to England shattered; he divorces and quits his job. Ben returns to his vocation. He follows the war on terror to Afghanistan and is killed. Stephen retreats to a cottage in the country to write a book about violence, and what he sees as the reporting journalist's or photographer's complicity in it; it is a book that will build in large part on Ben's writing and photography. Ben's widow, Kate, a sculptor, lives nearby, and as she and Stephen learn about each other their world speedily shrinks, in pleasing but also disturbing ways; Stephen's maid, with whom he has begun an affair, was once lovers with Kate's new studio assistant, an odd local man named Peter. As these connections become clear, Peter's strange behavior around Stephen and Kate begins to take on threatening implications. The sinister events that take place in this small town, so far from the theaters of war Stephen has retreated from, will force him to act instinctively, violently, and to face his most painful revelations about himself.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SAOPVTQqpq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2004-12-01",publisher:f,subtitle:g}},{id:5488,attributes:{title:"Re-reading Pat Barker",description:"Re-Reading Pat Barker brings together a number of scholars from across the world who explore in detail the work of one of Britain’s most notable contemporary novelists. The essays both acknowledge and engage with previous scholarship, re-establishing Barker’s eminence as a writer and adding to existing critical perspectives. In the collection, established Barker scholars return to her work, re-reading her novels to offer fresh and innovative readings, and other critics who have not previously published on Barker offer new insights into her body of work. The contributors examine a number of thematic concerns including matrilineal heritage, masculinity, the body, ways of seeing, institutional and personal violence, psychoanalysis and gender and class. The essays in the collection explore the broader social and historical aspects of Barker’s novels and the aesthetics and ethical issues in her work, drawing our attention to the ways that she engages with the world, gesturing towards new ways of seeing and to the possibilities of personal and political regeneration. The collection shows there is still much to say about the novels and the ways in which we choose to read them.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=NrbkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Pat Wheeler"],firstBook:d,published:"2020-05-15",publisher:"Cambridge Scholars Publishing",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377297986}}("","movie","Pat Barker",null,"Border Crossing","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","A Novel","series",1,"Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture Set in the north of England, Pat Barker's Border Crossing portrays a child psychiatrist who rescues a man from drowning one day while walking on a beach in Northumberland.
