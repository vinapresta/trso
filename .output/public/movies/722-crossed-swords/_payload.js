It had a hundred thousand inhabitants-some think double as many. The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. The houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. The higher the houses grew, the broader they grew. They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster. The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. The windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges, like doors.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iHVXrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2015-03-24",publisher:"CreateSpace",subtitle:"(Mark Twain Classics Collection)"}},{id:4694,attributes:{title:e,description:"A chance meeting between a member of the royal family and a street urchin triggers a course of events that form the basis of this enthralling story. Tom, the pauper; and Edward, the prince, discover that not only do they share the same birthday, but they also look identical. Being the boys that they are, they decide to have some fun and exchange clothes. However, little do they know that this will land them up in the most bizarre of situations. Inadvertently, the boys end up swapping places with each other - Tom becomes the prince; and Edward, the pauper. No one believes them when they try to explain their true identities, so they are forced to adapt to their new lifestyles, with very interesting consequences. This well-loved novel by Mark Twain takes a humorous look at 16th century society, and the inequalities that existed at that time, and perhaps still do today.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tiugDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2011-01-25",publisher:"Campfire",subtitle:"The Graphic Novel"}},{id:4695,attributes:{title:"The Complete Works of Mark Twain: The Prince and the pauper",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xc1SAVL0o7kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:4696,attributes:{title:"The Writings of Mark Twain: The prince and the pauper",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2ltNAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309464915}}("","Mark Twain","movie",null,"The Prince and the Pauper","series",1,"1909-01-01"))
