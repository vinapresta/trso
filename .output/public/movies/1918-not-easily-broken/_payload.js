Jakes explains from a Christian point of view how to re-evaluate and reconstruct your attitudes about giving, sharing, and reaping the rewards of life - financial and otherwise. He encourages readers to give themselves permission to succeed, give in a spirit of love, practice the discipline to observe the principle of divine portion, and so much more that will lead to prosperity and fulfilment.

The 64 lessons explore ideas like: 1. Good choices begin with research; 2. Quitting can be good, at the right time; 3. Begin before 'need' arises; 4. Regret can be the begging of triumph over adversity. For instance, we've all been told that quitters never win. But, there IS a time to quit, whether it's your job, marriage, church or project. The biggest problem with quitting is the timing. Quitting too soon may mean that you relinquish your dreams. Get comfortable with change. Even after you've repositioned yourself, change is constant. You may need to quit something in order to make room for the next season of your life. Before you quit anything, look within and determine your real motives. Revisit the longings deep in your heart. Get a clear perspective on what you're releasing and what your taking hold of. Examine your prior choices and consider what you've 'quit' in the past. This honest self-examination will prepare you for a new beginning.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7wTe5mhoTeUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[m],firstBook:c,published:"2011-05-12",publisher:n,subtitle:l}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568431955}}("movie","Not Easily Broken",null,"T.

When Clarice's leg is crushed in a car wreck, the obvious truth is finally exposed: her injuries aren't the only pain that needs immediate attention.
