Then she tries the neighbor, former officer Mauger (Burgess Meredith). This seems to work. But soon the son of the Lanlaires comes back. He is young, attractive, and does not share his mother's anti-Republican opinions. So Célestine's beauty attracts Captain Mauger, young Georges Lanlaire (Hurd Hatfield), and Joseph.

It was originally published as a serial between from 1891-2, and was later reworked and polished into a novel. It is presented as the diary of a chambermaid called Mademoiselle Celestine R. whose professional life is continually disrupted and diverted by the desires of her various employers. Octave Mirbeau (1848 - 1917) was a French playwright, travel writer, journalist, pamphleteer, art critic, and novelist whose work has been translated into thirty languages. Mirbeau became famous in Europe and enjoyed immense popularity, while simultaneously remaining appealing to the literary and artistic avant-garde. Other notable works by this author include: \"Sebastien Roch\" (1890), \"Dans le ciel\" (1893-1989), and \"Le Jardin des supplices\" (1899).

R. Tucker - A French chambermaid, who has served in Paris, in the houses of the nobility, the bourgeois, and professional people, finally enters the service of a rich couple living in the country, and there begins to keep a diary. In describing the events of her daily life and the people about her, she is frequently reminded of episodes in her past, and digresses to relate them. Thus her diary becomes a piquant panorama of social life and institutions. It is a terrific social exposure, a grim social satire, crammed with humor, bitterness, and truth. It has been described by a French critic as \"an attempt to show that nearly all the masters are low-lived wretches, and that nearly all the servants are as near like them as they know how to be.\" 'Well, such an atmosphere emanates from Joseph. The other day I admired him as he was lifting a cask of wine. He played with it like a child with its rubber ball. His exceptional strength, his supple skill, the terrible leverage of his loins, the athletic push of his shoulders, all combined to make me dreamy. The strange and unhealthy curiosity, prompted by fear as much as by attraction, which is excited in me by the riddle of these suspicious manners, of this closed mouth, of this impressing look, is doubled by this muscular power, this bull's back.'",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-NAUswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2015-07-13",publisher:"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform",subtitle:"A Novel of Sexual Exploration"}},{id:5197,attributes:{title:h,description:"The novel presents itself as the diary of Mademoiselle Célestine R., a chambermaid.
