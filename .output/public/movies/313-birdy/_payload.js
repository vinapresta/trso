Al and Birdy have just completed their service of duty in the Vietnam War and have returned to the States. Al sustained some serious physical injuries, which required major reconstructive surgery to his face. Birdy, however, returned from Vietnam seemingly emotionally scarred. He was missing in action for one month. He has not spoken since he was found. Despite his own medical issues, Al travels to the institution where Birdy is being kept to see if he can assist in getting Birdy out of his near comatose state. Having always had issues with authority, Al is less than forthright with the doctors about Birdy's mental state prior to the war. As Al tries whatever he can to help Birdy using tools from their shared history prior to the war, he deals with his own post-war mental state.",slug:"birdy"}}},books:{data:[{id:3028,attributes:{title:b,description:"The critically acclaimed Birdy is an inventive, hypnotic novel about friendship and family, love and war, madness and beauty, and, above all, \"birdness\".

However, he was also a very private man—he wrote under a pseudonym and rarely gave interviews—so fans and critics could only speculate how much of his work was autobiographical and how much was fiction. Now, for the first time, we are able to read the author's own account of his experiences during World War II—events that went on to influence some of his greatest works. These are the tales that Wharton never wanted to tell his children. Together, they illuminate a deeply personal, transformative experience: of learning to kill, to \"abandon my natural desire to live, survive, and to risk my life for reasons I often did not understand and sometimes did not accept.\" Moving and insightful, Shrapnel is a powerful, timeless work from an acclaimed American master.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vQ2czZLvMwMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2013-05-14",publisher:"Harper Collins",subtitle:"A Memoir"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309145416}}("","Birdy","William Wharton","movie",null,"series",1))
