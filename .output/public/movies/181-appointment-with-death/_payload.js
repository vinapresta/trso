A tiny puncture mark on her wrist was the only sign of the fatal injection that had killed her.With only 24 hours available to solve the mystery, Hercule Poirot recalled a chance remark he'd overheard back in Jerusalem: 'You see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?' Mrs Boynton was, indeed, the most detestable woman he'd ever met...To mark the 80th anniversary of Hercule Poirot's first appearance, and to celebrate his renewed fortunes as a primetime television star, this title in a collection of facsimile first editions is the perfect way to experience Agatha Christie. Reproducing the original typesetting and format of the first edition from the Christie family's own archive, this book sports the original cover which has been painstakingly restored to its original glory.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KD7BEUrV47gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2007-01-03",publisher:"HarperCollins UK",subtitle:e}},{id:2504,attributes:{title:c,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:e}},{id:2505,attributes:{title:c,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:e}},{id:2506,attributes:{title:"Agatha Christie: First Lady of Crime",description:"Includes a new introduction from Sophie Hannah, bestselling author of THE MONOGRAM MURDERS and HAVEN'T THEY GROWN Agatha Christie was not only the biggest selling writer of detective stories the world has ever known, she was also a mystery in herself, giving only the rarest interviews, declining absolutely to become any sort of public figure, and a mystery too in the manner in which she achieved her astonishing success. H R F Keating, a crime novelist and respected reviewer of crime fiction, brought together a dozen distinguished writers from both sides of the Atlantic to throw light on this double mystery. Some analyse the art itself; some explain the reasons for her success, not just the books, but also in film and theatre. The approaches are penetrating, affectionate, enthusiastic, analytical, funny - even critical. Together, they give an almost unique insight into the life and work of the First Lady of Crime.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2f7cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2020-10-01",publisher:"Hachette UK",subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568363021}}("Agatha Christie","movie","Appointment with Death",null,"","series",1,"Hercule Poirot's Jerusalem vacation is rudely interrupted by the murder of a woman whose hateful personality had won her a host of enemies","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=f7jyAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1992-01-01","Macmillan Reference USA"))
