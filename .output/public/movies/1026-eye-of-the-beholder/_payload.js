When he was a child, he thought he saw the angel of death. Now every time someone close to him dies, a mysterious blonde woman appears and he's forced to retreat, abandoning jobs and relationships in a never-ending flight across a hallucinatory version of the United States. Is the woman real, a figment of his imagination, or a supernatural apparition — perhaps even the devil incarnate? The Guardian praised Marc Behm as \"a terrific novelist,\" adding that \"Afraid to Death is a fascinating mirror image to The Eye of the Beholder.\" Behn's previous novel, also available from Dover Publications, spins a gripping tale of obsession and suspense in which a private investigator trails an enigmatic young woman. But this time the protagonist, a dissolute gambler, is being chased by a female character whose reoccurrences excite both fear and attraction.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kC-oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2019-08-14"))
