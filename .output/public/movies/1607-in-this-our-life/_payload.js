In the years following the Civil War, joy is hard to come by for twenty-year-old Dorinda Oakley. The daughter of a struggling farmer in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Dorinda is an intelligent, independent, and passionate young woman who dreams of life outside of her poor community. For the past year, she has worked at Nathan Pedlar’s Store to help her family—but then she falls in love with Jason Greylock, the handsome son of the local doctor. Now the real journey will begin for Dorinda, taking her far away from home and testing the resilience of her heart . . . A realistic portrayal of the changing, post–Civil War South, Barren Ground achieved critical praise when it was first published in 1925.

It is a fictional story of two sisters and their trials and tribulations in love and life. This is a fascinating work and it eventually became a Hollywood movie starring Bette Davies. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce. We are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=0o58CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2013-04-16","Read Books Ltd","Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow"))
