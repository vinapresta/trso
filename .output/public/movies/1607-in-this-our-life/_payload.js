In the years following the Civil War, joy is hard to come by for twenty-year-old Dorinda Oakley. The daughter of a struggling farmer in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Dorinda is an intelligent, independent, and passionate young woman who dreams of life outside of her poor community. For the past year, she has worked at Nathan Pedlar’s Store to help her family—but then she falls in love with Jason Greylock, the handsome son of the local doctor. Now the real journey will begin for Dorinda, taking her far away from home and testing the resilience of her heart . . .
