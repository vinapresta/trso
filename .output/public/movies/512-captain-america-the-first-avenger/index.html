While the shadow of involvement in World War II casts a pall of fear over a frightened United States, Captain America and his teenage sidekick, Bucky, fight for freedom at home and abroad. The stories collected in this volume continue Captain America&#39;s classic WWII adventures, featuring villains and scenarios which embodied the fears and anxieties of an America moving toward entrance into the war. Whether confronting colorful super-villains like the Black Toad, the White Death and his arch-nemesis the Red Skull, or matching wits with foreign agents and saboteurs, Cap and Bucky swashbuckle their way through some of the most creative adventures of the &#39;30s comics world. In fact, these adventures were for years held up to incoming Marvel artists and writers as examples of OHow to Do It Right. O These stories, along with those contained in Volume I of this series, also compete the full run of Captain America Comics collaborated upon by the characters&#39; creators, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Painstakingly restored and recolored, these classic stories would cost thousands of dollars to collect in their original form. Now, in this inexpensive format, this look back to both an historic era and the birth of a hero whose presence continues to be felt today, is a true find for collectors or casual comics fans alike.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb3832"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Th0auwAACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Marvel Masterworks" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Marvel Masterworks</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Joe Simon<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Marvel</span><span><span> - </span>9/5/2012</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Steve Rogers might have been the prototypical 98-pound weakling, but that wasn&#39;t going to stop him from serving his country.

This historical retrospective of Steve Rogers&#39; various uniforms and super-hero mantles is a showcase of America&#39;s ever-evolving sociopolitical landscape. From his early days fighting in overt patriotic garb as Captain America during World War II through his adoption of the predominately black uniform and title of the Captain at a time when he became a symbol of resisting absolute government control, Rogers has always worn his allegiance openly. Time and again, Steve has returned to Captain America&#39;s red-white-and-blue iconography, proving that the symbolic clothing of the Sentinel of Liberty stands for a higher ideal than any one person or government can achieve.

When Dr. Erskine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany&#39;s secret HYDRA research department (headed by Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. the Red Skull), Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot; however, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America, and his war against Schmidt begins.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">6.9/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">80%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">66/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Joe Simon: My Life in Comics, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
