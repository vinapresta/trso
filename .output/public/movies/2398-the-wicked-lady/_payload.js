It tells the story of Barbara Skelton, a well-born young woman trapped in a loveless marriage, who finds escape from the tedium of her life by leading a double life as a highway robber. Rich in historical detail and high on melodrama, the novel follows Barbara's infamous career of robbery, adultery and murder, without painting her entirely as a monster. Indeed, the novel's status as a bestseller owes much to King-Hall's sympathetic depiction of the frustrations of domestic life for an ambitious, intelligent woman with no means of self-expression.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rwz8CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Rowland Hughes","2016-05-01","Univ of Hertfordshire Press","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QtghIfqeiUUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1983-11-17","Penguin Group"))
