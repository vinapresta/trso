It addresses ideas of morality, social standing of women, class divide and its idiosyncrasies through the experiences of Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter of Mr and Mrs Bennet. All is calm and quiet in Longbourne until the summer when the mild-mannered Mr Bingley and his uptight friend Mr Darcy rent the nearby estate of Netherfield Park. Mr Bingley falls instantly for the shy, sensitive Jane, the eldest of the five Bennet girls, but sparks fly when Elizabeth and Mr Darcy meet. And so enters love, and with it comes turmoil into their young lives. Will Jane and Mr Bingley get together, despite their social differences? Will Elizabeth look beyond her first impressions of Mr Darcy? How will their choices affect their future as well as that of their sisters? This classic novel answers all this as Jane Austen skilfully weaves various themes that were quintessential to the lives of the landed gentry in early 19th century England.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yvjDDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:"Om Books International",subtitle:a}},{id:3474,attributes:{title:h,description:"From Longman's Cultural Editions series, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice , edited by Claudia Johnson and Susan Wolfson, offers the text of the first edition and is extensively annotated in several contexts, from Austen's views, to cultural issues, to first reviews and critical reception.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-49_PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,"Claudia L.
