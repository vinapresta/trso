E. Hotchner visited a close friend in the psychiatric ward of St. Mary&#39;s Hospital. It would be the last time they spoke - three weeks later, Ernest Hemingway returned home, where he took his own life. Their final conversation was also the final installment in a saga that Hemingway had unraveled for Hotchner over years of world travel. Ernest always kept a few of his special experiences off the page, storing them as insurance against a dry-up of ideas. But after a near miss with death, he entrusted his most meaningful tale to Hotchner, so that if he never got to write it himself, then at least someone would know. In characteristically pragmatic terms, Hemingway divulged the details of the affair that destroyed his first marriage: the truth of his romantic life in Paris and how he gambled and lost Hadley, the great love he&#39;d spend the rest of his life seeking. But the search was not without its notable moments, and he told of those, too: of impotence cured in a house of God; of back-to-back plane crashes in the African bush, one of which nearly killed him, while he emerged from the other brandishing a bottle of gin and a bunch of bananas; of cocktails and commiseration with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Josephine Baker; of adventure, human error, and life after lost love. This is Hemingway as few have known him - humble, thoughtful, and full of regret. To protect the feelings of Ernest&#39;s wife, Mary, who was also a close friend, Hotch kept these conversations to himself for decades. Now he tells the story as Hemingway told it to him.

Hotchner first met Paul Newman in 1956, when the relatively unknown actor assumed the role James Dean was to play in Hotchner&#39;s first television play, based on an Ernest Hemingway story. The project elevated both men from relative obscurity to stardom, and commenced a close and trusted friendship that lasted until Newman&#39;s death in 2008. In A Friendship, Hotchner presents a complicated, unpredictable and talented man and leads the reader through their shared adventures. The pair travelled extensively around the globe, and owned fishing boats that involved them in embarrassing incidents. They successfully defended themselves before a jury in a ludicrous two-year trial, and triumphed in a beery tennis match against Robert Redford and Jack Valenti. Most notably, they started a food company, Newman&#39;s Own, as a prank and watched it soar into a major enterprise that has given all its 200 million dollars of profits to charities. Hotchner&#39;s knowledge of Newman is unparalleled, and as a gifted storyteller he brings to the reader crucial insights Newman revealed about himself. A Friendshipis the story of an unusual friendship and a tribute to the beloved actor who gave to the world as much as the world gave him.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9081"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=EbyhdSv2ygYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book O.J. in the Morning, G&amp;T at Night" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>O.J. in the Morning, G&amp;T at Night</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->A.

E. Hotchner&#39;s elixir for aging happily, but after reading this charming collection of essays, you may wish you were. Nonagenarian, novelist, playwright, and biographer, Hotchner gives us heartfelt and laugh-out-loud anecdotes that describe his unique reflections on the aging process. His musings cover everything from the outlandish commercials that target the older generation (Viagra, Cialis, and Flomax) to suggestions on adapting the tennis game for seniors (he suggests lowering the net by two inches and moving all outer lines two feet inward) to the advantages of having a pet (his pet parrot often tells guests to &quot;kiss my ass&quot;). He can equally capture the headier side of aging, which is bittersweetly revealed in his piece about divorce. With his disarming, eloquent voice and dry sense of humor, Hotch illuminates life&#39;s wisdoms through his optimistic, witty, and romantic outlook, all the while making you feel, well, not unhappy about growing older. O.J. in the Morning, G&amp;T at Night is a book of courageous advice, humorous wisdom, and, above all, good strategies for how to stay young at heart.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9082"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=dQGxAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Boyhood Memoirs of A.E.
