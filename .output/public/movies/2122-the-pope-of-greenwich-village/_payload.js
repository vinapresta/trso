Between Grandpa Jessie, son Vito, and grandson Adam, the McMullen men represent a good portion of the ethnic groups in America-Cherokee Indian, Irish, Jewish, and Italian-but there's something \"unadulterated\" they all share-what Grandpa Jessie calls \"the criminal gene.\" And Jessie intends to capitalize on it with one last big scam that will keep them in clover forever. Although Vito has long since sworn off partnering with Jessie in his outrageous schemes, when he learns that Adam is the mastermind behind this scam, Vito reluctantly joins in to look out for his son. From the drunken revelry of an Irish wake in Brooklyn to a backstreet bar in Hell's Kitchen, to a not-so-secure genetic engineering firm in San Jose, FAMILY BUSINESS abounds in streetwise wit, colorful characters, and crisp dialogue, with all the strains of love and loyalty that exist in every family.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-rPerQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2014-10-14",publisher:b,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703507305}}("","Vincent Patrick","movie",null,"The Pope of Greenwich Village","series",1))
