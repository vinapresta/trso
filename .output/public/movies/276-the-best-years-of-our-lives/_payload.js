Fred Derry is an ordinary working man who finds it difficult to hold down a job or pick up the threads of his marriage. Having had both hands burnt off during the war, Homer Parrish is unsure that his fiancée's feelings are still those of love and not those of pity.

It takes awareness born of action and danger and keenly felt knowledge. Such knowl-edge MacKinlay Kantor has found, and in his novel of war and its men, Glory for Me, he has wholly expressed it. Well above the draft age, and physi-cally unacceptable to the armed forces, Kantor intensely felt the need to join his younger fellows in some way; in some way he had to be a part of the danger, the horror, the glory of this war.

MacKinlay Kantor's book for young readers captures all the emotions and drama of those few days in April 1865: Lee's mingled sorrow and relief, Grant's generosity toward his late opponent and the nearly starving Confederate soldiers; and the two commanders' negotiation of surrender terms intended to help heal the wounds of more than four years of the most violent conflict in American history.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Qkj2DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2016-10-15",publisher:"Young Voyageur",subtitle:a}},{id:2902,attributes:{title:"Signal Thirty-Two",description:"MACKINLAY KANTOR Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Andersonville The Twenty-Third Precinct of the New York City Police Department includes within its boundaries exalted penthouses and reeking slums. The story concerns three men in blue, their loves, their ambitions, their contentions-the cruelty they encounter, the courage they offer, the pity and aid they are able to give. It speeds through the reader's consciousness like a patrol car wailing in midnight traffic. In 1948 the Acting Commissioner of Police, the late Tom Mulligan, authorized MacKinlay Kantor to proceed on all police activities, accompanying the patrolmen in their work. Kantor learned the life of a policeman through first-hand experience. Such priv-ilege had never been granted to a civilian before. But this civilian happened to be the author of Long Re-member, The Voice of Bugle Ann, and many other famous books, as well as the original story of the great motion picture, \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\" Thunder of feet on sagging stairways; a yell from behind a locked door; tears and oaths and-worse- the stony agony of women who stare in silence... The radio voice of CB declares flatly: \"Two-Three Precinct. The address...on the roof...proceed with caution...\" Is it rape, suicide, assault? Or merely a kitten cry-ing from its trap in a drainpipe? Or do we meet the glare of a razor, the stab of gunfire in a hall? Our fingers squeeze the siren button. This is a Signal Thirty-two...
