Or think of someone you haven’t seen for years, only to answer the phone and hear that person on the line? Is it coincidence or is it something more? If you have ever wondered if you might be psychic, this book may hold the answer to this most intriguing question. As you will see, everybody has some psychic ability. For some people, the ability might be as mild as intuition; for others, it might be as strong as mediumship; but it all falls under the category of that “sixth sense.” Are You Psychic? is a fascinating and revealing look at our extrasensory powers. Author and professor of parapsychology Dr. Hans Holzer explores all the various forms of the psychic experience—foretelling the future, interpreting psychic feelings, thought transference, and past-life memories, among others. He explains, in clear and understandable language, what they are, how they work, and what you can do to develop your own inner abilities. He delves into the history of psychic abilities; discusses the psychic experiences of dreams, déjà vu, and out-of-body experience; and shows how natural healing can be a form of the human psychic ability. Throughout the book, Dr. Holzer gives examples of real-life psychic phenomena that illustrate how these powers work—and demonstrate that they are very real. If you are one of those people who have had their fair share of those “funny coincidences,” maybe it’s time to find out more. Maybe it’s time to answer the question you have asked yourself a hundred times—Are You Psychic?",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=fUCudZDENuoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1997-06-01",publisher:g,subtitle:"Unlocking the Power Within"}},{id:2321,attributes:{title:"Murder in Amityville",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1979-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:2322,attributes:{title:"Ghost Hunter",description:"Fifty years before The Conjuring, Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters, Insidious and Most Haunted, there was Hans Holzer—a man known as the “Father of the Paranormal.” Holzer pioneered ghost-hunting methods still used today, and brought ghosts and ghost hunting into popular culture in the second half of the twentieth century. Ghost Hunter presented some of the first-ever case studies of haunting investigations, taken from Holzer’s own practice in the New York City area—ranging from Civil War-era spirits to the tormented ghosts of murder victims. For devoted ghost-hunting aficionados curious about the practice’s history, there is no better place to start than the first book Hans Holzer wrote, Ghost Hunter. This is the classic 1963 book that launched his publishing career and gained him international fame. The prestige edition of the classic, trail-blazing work on ghost hunting will intrigue new fans and longtime devotees alike—part of the new Tarcher Supernatural Library. The first three titles released in Tarcher's Supernatural Library are Ghost Hunter (by Hans Holzer), Romance of Sorcery (by Sax Rohmer) and Isis in America (by Henry Steel Olcott).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UppPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2014-08-28",publisher:g,subtitle:"The Groundbreaking Classic of Paranormal Investigation"}},{id:2323,attributes:{title:"The Amityville Curse",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2007-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Fact & Fiction"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703447565}}("","Hans Holzer","movie",null,"series",1,"Penguin"))
