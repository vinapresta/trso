This furious, slapstick tale has been praised by the New York Times as one of the “best and brightest” novels about the Vietnam War. We follow the travails of Harvey Brank and his fellow employees, all undrafted malcontents working in a spectacularly small-minded, almost Kafkaesque engineering company. Assigned to build a fighter plane and drawn into office intrigues, Brank faces impossible demands. His wife, despairing of his patchy employment history and restlessness, hopes against hope that Brank won’t get himself fired this time. But what do you do when everything conspires against your vision of a decent, peaceable life? Easy and Hard Ways Out is a blunt, freewheeling look at the men who stay home during wartime—a story about the everyday, with a timeless moral at its heart.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=52XGhpPrrxkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:c,published:"2013-01-22",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:2881,attributes:{title:"Black Action Films",description:"From the late 1960s on, there has been one highly profitable movie genre that has received little or no critical attention or documentation--black action pictures.

Here the genre is given its due in this comprehensive compilation of four filmmaking decades.
