She tactfully rebuffs the advances of Caspar Goodwood, another American who has followed her to England. Her cousin, Ralph Touchett, wise but sickly becomes a soulmate of sorts for her. She makes an unfortunate alliance with the creepy Madame Merle who leads her to make an even more unfortunate alliance with Gilbert Osmond, a smooth but cold collector of Objets' de art who seduces her with an intense but unattainable sexuality. Isabel marries Osmond only to realize she's just another piece of art for his collection and that Madame Merle and Osmond are lovers who had hatched a diabolical scheme to take Isabel's fortune. Isabel's only comfort is the innocent daughter of Osmond, Pansy, but even that friendship is spoiled when Countess Gemini, Osmond's sister, reveals the child's true parentage. Isabel finally breaks free of Osmond and returns to Ralph's bedside, where, while breathing his last, they both realize how truly connected they are, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.",slug:"the-portrait-of-a-lady"}}},books:{data:[{id:10492,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=NdsxAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1882-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10493,attributes:{title:d,description:"Isabel Archer is a young, intelligent, and spirited American girl, determined to relish her first experience of Europe.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=p7DFlmNWQP4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2009-04-09",publisher:"Oxford University Press",subtitle:a}},{id:10494,attributes:{title:"The Novels and Tales of Henry James",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=v8ebIdXRLkgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"1907-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10495,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9JJfQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"1947-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10496,attributes:{title:"The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)",description:"This eBook features the unabridged text of ‘The Portrait of a Lady’ from the bestselling edition of ‘The Complete Works of Henry James’.
