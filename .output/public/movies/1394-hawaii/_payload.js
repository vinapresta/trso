Michener brings Hawaii’s epic history vividly to life in a classic saga that has captivated readers since its initial publication in 1959. As the volcanic Hawaiian Islands sprout from the ocean floor, the land remains untouched for centuries—until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers make the perilous journey across the Pacific, flourishing in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions. Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life. Based on exhaustive research and told in Michener’s immersive prose, Hawaii is the story of disparate peoples struggling to keep their identity, live in harmony, and, ultimately, join together.

It is a work of fiction, yet so true to the spirit and the history of the islands that it can properly be called the first major chronicle of the land and its people - a monumental tribute that will stand indefinitely. The volcanic process by which the Hawaiian Islands grew from the ocean floor were inconceivably slow, and they remained, undiscovered and untouched by man, for countless centuries more until the Polynesians, little more than a thousand years ago made the perilous and incredible journey to their new home. Those passionate and beautiful people lived and flourished in the islands according to their ancient traditions and beliefs until in the early nineteenth century, the American missionaries arrived, bringing a new creed and a new way of life to stone-aged society. The impact of the coming of the missionaries had only begun to be absorbed when other national groups, with equally different customs - notably the Chinese, the Japanese and the Filipinos - began to migrate in great numbers to the islands. The story of modern Hawaii, and of this book, is one of how disparate peoples, struggling to keep their identity, yet live with each other in harmony, ultimately joined together to build our strong and vital fiftieth state. Mr. Michener has told this story in terms of highly individual characters whom readers will not soon forget - men and women of many nations, from the time of the earliest voyagers to arrive in Hawaii by canoe to the eve of statehood. His emphasis is on the characters, their personal triumphs and tragedies, loves and hatreds; but their compelling dramas are acted in front of an accurate and informative background of history.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=AEGpxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"2019-06-16",publisher:d,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703584284}}("movie","Hawaii",null,"","James A.
