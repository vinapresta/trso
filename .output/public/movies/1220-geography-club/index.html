Who knew?&quot;&quot; Russel Middlebrook is twenty-three years old, gay, and living in trendy Seattle, but life isn&#39;t keeping up with the hype. Most of his friends have a direction in life-either ruthlessly pursuing their careers or passionately embracing their own aimlessness. But Russel is stuck in place. All he knows is that crappy jobs, horrible dates, and pointless hook-ups just aren&#39;t cutting it anymore. What&#39;s the secret? What does everyone else know that he doesn&#39;t? Enter Kevin, Russel&#39;s perfect high school boyfriend. Could rekindling an old flame be the thing Russel needs to get his life back on track? Or maybe the answer lies in a new friend, an eccentric screenwriter named Vernie Rose, who seems plenty wise. Or what the hell? Maybe Russel will find some answers by joining his best friend Gunnar&#39;s crazy search for the legendary Bigfoot One way or another, Russel is determined to learn the all-important secret to life, even if it&#39;s a thing he doesn&#39;t even know he doesn&#39;t know. Author Brent Hartinger first made a splash writing books for teens. &quot;The Thing I Didn&#39;t Know I Didn&#39;t Know,&quot; Hartinger&#39;s first book for older readers, is just as much of a page-turner as his earlier works, with plenty of his trademark irreverent humor. But now his books have grown up along with his readers, exploring the issues of new adults, especially the complicated matter of love and sex. &quot;Praise for Brent Hartinger&quot; &quot;Hits the narrative sweet spot.&quot; - NPR&#39;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; &quot;Downright refreshing.&quot; - &quot;USA Today&quot; BRENT HARTINGER is an author, teacher, playwright, and screenwriter. &quot;Geography Club,&quot; the book in which Russel Middlebrook first appears (as a teenager), is also a successful stage play and a feature film co-starring Scott Bakula. In 1990, Brent helped found one of the world&#39;s first gay teen support groups, in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington. In 2005, he co-founded the entertainment website AfterElton.com, which was sold to MTV/Viacom in 2006. He now lives in Seattle with his husband, Michael Jensen.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb6757"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=BOM-pTUPtuIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Dreamquest" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Dreamquest</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Brent Hartinger<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Macmillan</span><span><span> - </span>4/29/2008</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Eleven-year-old Julie Fray is living a nightmare. Her parents are fighting so much she can&#39;t even escape when she goes to sleep. Every night she has horrible dreams--and all she wants is for them to stop. Then one night she wakes up inside her dream, in the studio where her dreams are produced! There is even a star who looks just like Julie who plays her in her dreams. With some help from a production assistant named Roman, Julie learns that if she can somehow find the people responsible for producing her dreams, she might be able to make them less scary. But it won&#39;t be easy: the tiny tear in the &quot;fabric&quot;of her consciousness that let her fall into the dream studio in the first place is closing fast...and she could be trapped inside her own head forever! Even worse, it turns out that when Julie fell into her dreams, Vivian, the actress who plays Julie in her dreams, escaped into the waking world--and the fake Julie will stop at nothing to take over Julie&#39;s life.

Russell is still going on dates with girls, while Kevin will do anything to prevent his football teammates from finding out what he is concealing, Min and Terese tell everyone they&#39;re really just good friends, and Ike can&#39;t figure out who he is or what he wants to be. But the truth is too hard to hide - at least from each other - so they form the Geography Club. Nobody else will discover the truth about them as no other students in their right minds would ever join a club that sounds so boring. Their secrets will be safe from classmates. But are they? &quot;Geography Club&quot; is a smart, fast, moving and funny account of contemporary teenagers as they discover their own sexual identities, dreams and values and not merely live out their parents&#39; desires and ambitions. Russell, Kevin, Min, Terese and Ike may not learn about actual places in their undercover social club, but they daringly explore the danger-filled, clique-mined landscape of Goodkind High School and courageously begin their journey in the exciting, still uncharted terrain of the human heart.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">6.6/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">67%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">57/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Geography Club, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
