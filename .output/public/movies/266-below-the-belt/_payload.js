Small time radio talk show host Terry Glantz is the latest in the long line of her steady but not really committed boyfriends. And she works in a dead end job as a waitress in a sports arena. Bobby Fox, who sees her physically handle the unwanted advances of a co-worker, is a professional wrestling promoter who thinks she looks like a natural for the sport despite she being diminutive in size. Mutually parting ways with both her current job and with Terry, Rosa decides to give it a try. She is sent to professional wrestling school, and then on the road with Bobby's stable of wrestlers to watch and learn. In both situations, what Rosa also learns is that there is much camaraderie amongst the wrestlers out of emotional need as it is a lonely life. While some look for their soul mate within their traveling partners, others just want a body - any body - to keep them warm at night. She also learns the pros and cons of the sport itself. Rosa's professional wrestling career may be short lived as Bobby wants her first bout to be with Terrible Tommy J., the queen of the sport. Although professional wrestling is acting more than anything, Tommy, who has forty pounds over Rosa, often treats it like real life to exert her power and superiority over her colleagues, who she sees more as competitors wanting to dethrone her.",slug:"below-the-belt"}}},books:{data:[{id:2849,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:i,authors:[f],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:2850,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[f],firstBook:e,published:g,publisher:"Weidenfeld & Nicolson",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:2851,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Robert Fowler"],firstBook:e,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Screenplay"}},{id:2852,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:i,authors:[f],firstBook:e,published:g,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:2853,attributes:{title:"Three Novels",description:"Rosalyn Drexler embarked upon a vibrant career as a pop artist, playwright, screenwriter, pseudonymous author, short-lived Mexican wrestler, and a writer of surreal, satirical, and beguiling comedic fictions, three of which are collected in this omnibus. Highly regarded by Norman Mailer, Gloria Steinem, Stanley Elkin, and Donald Barthelme, Drexler's short fragmented novels have faded into relative obscurity alongside numerous postmodern or \"avant-pop\" writers, deserving of a fresh audience and to be read for their brilliant comedic energy and sharp satirical eye. I am the Beautiful Stranger is a bold novel of teenage sexuality, familial dysfunction, and knotty self-awakening; One or Another the darkly comic tale of collapsing marriage, infidelity, and racial unrest; and The Cosmopolitan Girl explores the unlikely romance between a style-obsessed woman and her talking dog.
