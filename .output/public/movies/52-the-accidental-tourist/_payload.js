Travel writer Macon Leary hates travel, adventure, surprises, and anything outside of his routine. Immobilized by grief, Macon is becoming increasingly prickly and alone, anchored by his solitude and an unwillingness to compromise his creature comforts. Then he meets Muriel, an eccentric dog trainer too optimistic to let Macon disappear into himself. Despite Macon’s best efforts to remain insulated, Muriel up-ends his solitary, systemized life, catapulting him into the center of a messy, beautiful love story he never imagined. A fresh and timeless tale of unexpected bliss, The Accidental Tourist showcases Tyler’s talents for making characters—and their relationships—feel both real and magical. “Incandescent, heartbreaking, exhilarating…One cannot reasonably expect fiction to be much better than this.” —The Washington Post Look for Clock Dance, the charming new novel from Anne Tyler, available now.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=8nJ-BtrxPS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"2007-12-18",publisher:"Vintage",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:1954,attributes:{title:d,description:"Adult fiction; This title is also available as a film.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=gZVCPefrMiUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:f,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"Random House",subtitle:b}},{id:1955,attributes:{title:d,description:"How does a man addicted to routine cope with the chaos of everyday life?
