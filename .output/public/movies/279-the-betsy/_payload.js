Loren Hardeman, known as “Number One,” is gradually transferring control of Bethlehem Motors to his grandson, Loren Hardeman III—a man possessed with his father’s cunning, but sadly lacking in his ability to go for the kill. So when Angelo Perino, an outsider previously nurtured by Number One, threatens the position held by Hardeman III, what ensues is a battle of wills in which integrity takes a backseat to animal instinct, and in which there can only be one winner. Bursting with huge ingredients of lust, greed, sex, and intrigue—and a plot full of twists and double-crosses—this is Harold Robbins at his sizzling best.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_G9FOATqZ2EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:d,published:"2012-06-19",publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:2914,attributes:{title:"Tycoon",description:"Jack Lear rises from a modest Jewish background to take on the WASP world, but never quite feels he's succeeded in his ambition to be accepted as one of them.

He continues to hunger for what he cannot have. Here is a tale that only Harold Robbins could tell: of Jack’s torrid relationship with his first wife, a WASP social heiress; of his affairs with everybody from chamber maids to duchesses; of his second marriage to a world-class beauty and society figure; and ultimately of his life-long struggle to make his network # 1, and to give it a sense of class that sets it apart from all the others.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7OwhNi_9SDkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:d,published:"2012-12-25",publisher:h,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531274325}}("","movie","series",null,"The Betsy","Harold Robbins",1,"Simon and Schuster"))
