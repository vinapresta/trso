The story takes place in 1903. During a train trip, psychiatrist Dr. Huntington Bailey meets a friendly older lady, when she turns to him for reassurance during a torrential downpour. She tells him that she is going to visit her brother Nick and his lovely young wife Allida, both of whom she effectively raised. Once in New York, Bailey hears that his train companion suddenly died while visiting her brother for tea. Shortly afterwards, he meets the strange couple and becomes suspicious of Nick's treatment of his wife. Nick keeps Allida, whom he is trying to pass off as crazy, a virtual prisoner in their town house (a New York brownstone in the film), cutting off all contact with the outside world. The kindly Bailey takes it upon himself to attempt to free his new love, Allida, from the control of the insanely jealous Nick. A frenzied gun battle and fist fight in their home, featuring the destruction of several large aquariums, replete with shattered glass, gushing water and floundering fish, may be the most memorable (and most often imitated) scene in the film. The house burns to the ground because of Nick's actions (killing him), but Allida, her son and Hunt end up living happily in the country.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OklEAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:e,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:5923,attributes:{title:"EXPERIMENT PERILOUS ",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=0fjry7KAoT0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:b,published:e,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:5924,attributes:{title:"A Survey of Michigan County Library Users",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=u--q-PArkLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Margaret Murray Wylie"],firstBook:b,published:"1948-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Cooperative Project"}},{id:5925,attributes:{title:"Index to Readers for Grades 5 Through 8",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=w9KJcCP3tRQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Margaret McCarthy"],firstBook:b,published:"1941-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940964373}}("",null,"Experiment Perilous","Margaret Carpenter","1943-01-01"))
