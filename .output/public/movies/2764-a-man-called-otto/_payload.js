He's a curmudgeon; the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him 'the bitter neighbor from hell'. But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul.

Fredrik Backman’s novels have delighted readers with their irrepressible charm, whimsy, and warmth. Now, for the first time, all three of his novels are collected in one boxed set, making this a perfect gift for both longtime and new fans. In A Man Called Ove, an unexpected friendship forms when a young family moves next door to the neighborhood curmudgeon. In this feel-good tale of love and redemption, Backman explores the profound impact one life has on countless others. My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry is the story of a young girl named Elsa who is struggling after the death of her beloved and eccentric grandmother. When she discovers a series of letters her grandmother wrote apologizing to people she had wronged, Elsa embarks on a life-changing adventure. With humor and heart, this is a story about life and death and one of the most important human rights: the right to be different. Finally, in Britt-Marie Was Here, Backman tells the “heartwarming story about a woman rediscovering herself after a personal crisis…fans of Backman will find another winner in these pages” (Publishers Weekly). When the fastidious Britt-Marie leaves her cheating husband and starts over in a small backwater town, she never expects to find herself drawn into the lives of its quirky and odd inhabitants. Most alarming of all, she’s given the impossible task of leading the supremely untalented children’s soccer team to victory. In this small town of misfits, can Britt-Marie find a place where she truly belongs?",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=at0zDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2017-11-07",publisher:d,subtitle:"A Man Called Ove, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry, and Britt-Marie Was Here"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309102186}}("Fredrik Backman","movie",false,"Simon and Schuster","A Novel","series",1,"A Man Called Ove",""))
