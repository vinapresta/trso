True, the people there weren't really a \"community\", but they never noticed...until a stranger named Joshua rolled into town one morning. In small ways, Joshua begins to help out around the town--helping a teen learn to play the guitar, helping to save a marriage in crisis, or teaching a bumbling priest how to speak about faith. An old Baptist church that came down in a storm is his next big project. With help from stuttering Theo who dreams of being a preacher, he brings the town together to restore the old building, and the whole town truly becomes a united community. This attracts the attention of Father Tordone, who is a bitter over losing a position in the Vatican. When the mysterious Joshua begins to show up in two places at once and miraculously cures a blind woman, Father Tordone believes that he is a false prophet trying to cheat people. When his next huge miracle--reviving Theo from death after he falls from the roof of the newly completed church--overwhelms the town, Father Tordone seeks out an official condemnation from the Vatican. But Joshua melts his icy heart, and the reformed Father becomes a Vatican member. Joshua sees the Pope himself and reveals himself as Jesus. After his meeting, Joshua leaves--but the people of Auburn have had their dreams fulfilled and their happiness increased.",slug:"joshua"}}},books:{data:[{id:8760,attributes:{title:d,description:"Tells the story of Joshua, the simple, hardworking man who does beautiful carpentry and has an extraordinary effect on everyone he meets, transforming them with warmth and love",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=NO27Dpc8bE8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[h],firstBook:true,published:i,publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:b}},{id:8761,attributes:{title:d,description:"Tells the story of Joshua, the simple, hardworking man who does beautiful carpentry and has an extraordinary effect on everyone he meets, transforming them with warmth and love.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=F6adM2wBREoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"2002-01-01",publisher:j,subtitle:b}},{id:8762,attributes:{title:"The Parables of Joshua",description:"Reinterprets the parables of the New Testament to preserve the timeless messages behind the original scriptural passages by making them relevant to modern audiences.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=NiWhcrL_GoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"2001-01-01",publisher:"Doubleday Books",subtitle:b}},{id:8763,attributes:{title:"Joshua in a Troubled World",description:"The bestselling Joshua series takes an invigorating, timely new turn as Girzone’s beloved hero spreads his message of love and compassion from the streets of our nation’s capital to the blood-soaked lands of the Middle East. Joseph Girzone possesses a unique ability to make Jesus’ words and actions come to life for contemporary audiences. His fictional depictions of Jesus’ return to the present-day world—the Joshua series—have inspired millions of readers. Joshua in a Troubled World is at once a magnificent continuation of his perennially popular series and an enlightening perspective on the political paranoia and destructive acts of vengeance that fill the front pages of our daily newspapers. Arriving in Washington, D.C., Joshua walks along Pennsylvania Avenue with a cool detachment and determination that sets him apart from the bustling crowds. Under ordinary circumstances, he would no doubt be seen simply as a man wrapped in his own thoughts. But in these security-obsessed times, his Middle Eastern appearance and his spontaneous stops at various churches, temples, and mosques inevitably arouse suspicions. Taken into custody by two government agents, Joshua challenges the legal and moral justness of their actions and they reluctantly release him to continue his mission. It is the most difficult and controversial mission he has ever undertaken—a plan to unite Arab- and Jewish-Americans and to work with them to resolve the bitter wars and religious animosities in the Middle East. Peopled with prominent figures such as Ariel Sharon, and moving from Washington to Beirut and then to Oslo while the peace accords are being hammered out, Joshua in a Troubled World explores the most explosive issues of our day and offers a realistic, compassionate assessment of the things that divide us and the beliefs that can serve as a foundation for a new, more peaceful world.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1GdHEfu24PoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"2005-02-15",publisher:"Image",subtitle:"A Story for Our Time"}},{id:8764,attributes:{title:"Joshua and the Children",description:"The Story Continues... Joseph F. Girzone has woven another magical story, a modern-day parable, in Joshua and the Children, which gracefully continues the teachings and inspirations from his previous bestseller, Joshua. A stronger Joshua arrives in a deceptively ordinary village only to witness the doings of unscrupulous leaders and violent people. The children are the first to recognize that something is quite different about this stranger who has come seemingly from nowhere. It is through the villagers' children that Joshua is able to restore a sense of peacefulness and honesty. \"A new day had dawned, a new spirit spread throughout the land, and it all seemed to have happened because of the simple, unassuming goodness of one gentle stranger who knew only how to love.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HwYZ_jRpsFIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[h],firstBook:c,published:i,publisher:j,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703552423}}("movie","",null,"Joshua","Joseph F.
