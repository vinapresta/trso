Fox invites the reader into a life so full-from his mother dressing him up in women&#39;s clothing to his father coercing him into medical school; his search for belonging in the &quot;families&quot; of academia, publishing, beatniks and hipsters, Latin America, transsexuals, Judaism, and his own progeny; and the seemingly-glamorous whirlwind world of the arts and culture-that it leaves little else to be desired. Originally from Chicago, Fox studied culture intensely and traveled widely becoming thoroughly Latinized by early adulthood. Much of Fox&#39;s life was shaped by his international interests-from his publishing and academic careers to his personal tastes and selection in women-which factored largely into his career successes and personal adventures.

The book offers a unique balance of theory and clear-cut choices for customizing every phase of a qualitative study. A scholarly mix of classic and contemporary studies from multiple disciplines provides compelling, field-based examples of the full range of qualitative approaches. Readers learn about adaptive ways of designing studies, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting findings. Key aspects of the researcher&#39;s craft are addressed, such as fieldwork options, the five phases of data analysis (with and without using computer-based software), and how to incorporate the researcher&#39;s “declarative” and “reflective” selves into a final report. Ideal for graduate-level courses, the text includes:* Discussions of ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, feminist research, and other approaches.* Instructions for creating a study bank to get a new study started.* End-of-chapter exercises and a semester-long, field-based project.* Quick study boxes, research vignettes, sample studies, and a glossary.* Previews for sections within chapters, and chapter recaps.* Discussion of the place of qualitative research among other social science methods, including mixed methods research.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12763"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=LJ8XtAEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Reading Log" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Reading Log</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Thomas Publications<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Createspace Independent Publishing Platform</span><span><span> - </span>6/3/2017</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Keeping reading logs can help you or your students, to measure their progress and motivate them.
