Fox invites the reader into a life so full-from his mother dressing him up in women's clothing to his father coercing him into medical school; his search for belonging in the \"families\" of academia, publishing, beatniks and hipsters, Latin America, transsexuals, Judaism, and his own progeny; and the seemingly-glamorous whirlwind world of the arts and culture-that it leaves little else to be desired. Originally from Chicago, Fox studied culture intensely and traveled widely becoming thoroughly Latinized by early adulthood. Much of Fox's life was shaped by his international interests-from his publishing and academic careers to his personal tastes and selection in women-which factored largely into his career successes and personal adventures. Never one to be content with the average or mundane, Fox keeps the pace moving with one exciting revelation or humorously self-interested remark after another. The picture of self-awareness-and -actualization?-Fox's question of Who, Me? has not so much to do with the author\u002Fpoet\u002Fscholar he's become as it does with how he evolved into this multifaceted character of his own creation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tUWPZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Hugh Fox"],firstBook:true,published:"2011-06-12",publisher:"Sunbury Press, Incorporated",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:12760,attributes:{title:"Maybe It's You",description:"How can a girl who’s been rejected by Once Upon A Time ever believe that happily-ever-after even exists?

The book offers a unique balance of theory and clear-cut choices for customizing every phase of a qualitative study. A scholarly mix of classic and contemporary studies from multiple disciplines provides compelling, field-based examples of the full range of qualitative approaches. Readers learn about adaptive ways of designing studies, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting findings. Key aspects of the researcher's craft are addressed, such as fieldwork options, the five phases of data analysis (with and without using computer-based software), and how to incorporate the researcher's “declarative” and “reflective” selves into a final report. Ideal for graduate-level courses, the text includes:* Discussions of ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, feminist research, and other approaches.* Instructions for creating a study bank to get a new study started.* End-of-chapter exercises and a semester-long, field-based project.* Quick study boxes, research vignettes, sample studies, and a glossary.* Previews for sections within chapters, and chapter recaps.* Discussion of the place of qualitative research among other social science methods, including mixed methods research.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lyCGBeo8sI8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Robert K.
