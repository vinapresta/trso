The Chicago White Sox, considered the cream of the crop and one of the best major league teams ever, has just won the American League pennant, and are odds on favorites to win the World Series against the Reds. While team owner Charles A. Comiskey publicly crows about the superiority of the team he has assembled especially in their cohesion, he is unaware that arguably the cohesion in the players' determination to win is matched only by their feeling of unappreciation by Comiskey, especially financially as he screws them over time and time again on promises made. Sensing an opportunity, professional gamblers begin to feel out who they believe may be sympathetic Chicago players to a game and\u002For series fixing scheme, especially lucrative seeing as the to the disparity between the two teams. There end up being eight players \"in\" to various degrees, from being the \"all in\" negotiators between the gamblers and the players, to those somewhat unaware of what is happening, to those just in the know but remain silent. Things quickly go off the rails as each individual and group is looking out solely for his own interest, from the disparate groups of players, to the gamblers, to the scheme financiers, to the team owners - Comiskey and others - as closely watching sports journalists can see that some of the Sox players are not playing as hard or as well as they can.",slug:"eight-men-out"}}},books:{data:[{id:5648,attributes:{title:a,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:i}},{id:5649,attributes:{title:a,description:j,thumbnail:c,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1979-01-01",publisher:"New York : Pocket Books ; Markham, Ont. : Distributed in Canada by PaperJacks",subtitle:c}},{id:5650,attributes:{title:a,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:i}},{id:5651,attributes:{title:"Off-season",description:"John Clyde Cagle Jr returns in triumph as the legendary \"\"Black Jack\"\", superstar of the Los Angeles Dodgers, a menacing mound demon with a Fu Manchu moustache and a 106 mile-per-hour fastball.

Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=c7Z0oEl3Y_MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-04-01","Holt Paperbacks","The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series","This book, dramatized for a movie in 1988, covers the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the 1919 World Series."))
