This classic bildungsroman tells the story of Philip Carey, a sensitive boy born with a clubfoot who is orphaned and raised by a religious aunt and uncle. Philip yearns for adventure, and at eighteen leaves home, eventually pursuing a career as an artist in Paris. When he returns to London to study medicine, he meets the androgynous but alluring Mildred and begins a doomed love affair that will change the course of his life. There is no more powerful story of sexual infatuation, of human longing for connection and freedom. &quot;Here is a novel of the utmost importance,&quot; wrote Theodore Dreiser on publication. &quot;It is a beacon of light by which the wanderer may be guided. . . . One feels as though one were sitting before a splendid Shiraz of priceless texture and intricate weave, admiring, feeling, responding sensually to its colors and tones.&quot; With an Introduction by Gore Vidal Commentary by Theodore Dreiser and Graham Greene</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9740"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=o_M9zgEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Of Human Bondage" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Of Human Bondage</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->W Somerset Maugham<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->2/21/2021</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>In the beginning of the 20th century 9-year-old Philip Carey became an orphan, and was sent for bringing up to his uncle in Blackstable. His uncle was a vicar and did not feel soft feelings toward his nephew, but in his house Philip found a lot of different books, which helped him to forget about his solitude. In the school, where he was sent, he was mocked at because of his club foot. These mocking made him very timid and bashful, it seemed to him that suffer was his destiny. Philip begged God to make him healthy, and after it had not happened, he was the only one he blamed. He thought that his faith was not strong enough. He hated school, and there was no way he considered continuing his education at Oxford, as his uncle wanted.

Maugham had a stammer, and Phillip had a club foot; as well as the main character Maugham has lost his mother when was a child and was sent to his uncle and aunt; Maugham also was very interested in art, though did not practice it himself. This all gives an impression of an autobiographic novel, but as Maugham said himself, even though this is true, the novel is not an autobiographical, most of it is fictional.The title is borrowed from Spinoza&#39;s Ethics, part IV &quot;Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions&quot;. The idea of bondage as an inability of people to take control over their emotions became a monument point for Maugham to develop the plot.In the beginning of the 20th century 9-year-old Philip Carey became an orphan, and was sent for bringing up to his uncle in Blackstable. His uncle was a vicar and did not feel soft feelings toward his nephew, but in his house Philip found a lot of different books, which helped him to forget about his solitude.In the school, where he was sent, he was mocked at because of his club foot. These mocking made him very timid and bashful, it seemed to him that suffer was his destiny. Philip begged God to make him healthy, and after it had not happened, he was the only one he blamed. He thought that his faith was not strong enough. He hated school, and there was no way he considered continuing his education at Oxford, as his uncle wanted. Philip himself wanted to study in Germany, and he managed to achieve his aim.In Germany Philip got acquainted with Hayward and got under his influence. Hayward was talented and rather out of the common. The arguments of Hayward with other people about religion and literature left a very significant track in Philip&#39;s soul: in one moment he understood that did not believe in God anymore, was not afraid of hell, and a human should be responsible for his deeds only before himself.Having returned from Germany to England Philip met a daughter of the former Mr. Carey&#39;s assistant in Blackstable. She was about 30, mincing and rather flirtatious. At first Philip did not like her, but even though, she became soon his lover. Being very proud Philip wrote Hayward about his love affair, describing it very vividly and romantically. But in fact when Ms. Wilkinson left he was rather relieved, but he felt a little sad because the really did not coincide with the dreams.Mr. Carey having already accepted the Philip&#39;s unwillingness to study at Oxford, sent him to London to become a clerk. But this profession was not for Philip and without friends he felt really lonely in a big city. But then he got a letter from Hayward with an invitation to go to Paris and study there art. It seemed to Philip that this idea had been maturing in his soul as well, and disregarding his uncle&#39;s objections Philip left for Paris. There he joined the artistic studio and met a girl called Fanny Price. She was rather unattractive and not neat. Nobody could stand her because of her rudeness and self-conceit, even though she had little talent in drawing. But she helped Philip to adapt to circumstances and he stayed very grateful.The life of Paris bohemia changed Philip&#39;s world outlook: he did not consider anymore ethical tasks the main for art, but as before saw the life in the spectrum of Christian virtue.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9742"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=lECqtAEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Of Human Bondage" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Of Human Bondage</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->W.

Somerset Maugham. It is generally agreed to be his masterpiece and to be strongly autobiographical in nature, although Maugham stated, &quot;This is a novel, not an autobiography, though much in it is autobiographical, more is pure invention.&quot; Maugham, who had originally planned to call his novel Beauty from Ashes, finally settled on a title taken from a section of Spinoza&#39;s Ethics. The Modern Library ranked Of Human Bondage No. 66 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The book begins with the death of Helen Carey, the much beloved mother of nine-year-old Philip Carey. Philip has a club foot and his father had died a few months before. Now orphaned, he is sent to live with his aunt Louisa and uncle William Carey. Early chapters relate Philip&#39;s experiences at his uncle&#39;s vicarage. Aunt Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle takes a cold disposition towards him. Philip&#39;s uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to find ways to escape his mundane existence. Less than a year later, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt wish for him to eventually attend Oxford. Philip&#39;s disability and sensitive nature make it difficult for him to fit in with the other students. Philip is informed that he could have earned a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster see as a wise course, but Philip insists on going to Germany. In Germany, Philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners. He enjoys his stay in Germany. Philip&#39;s guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they persuade him to move to London to take up an apprenticeship. He does not fare well there as his co-workers resent him, because they believe he is a &quot;gentleman.&quot; He goes on a business trip with one of his managers to Paris and is inspired by the trip to study art in France. In France, Philip attends art classes and makes new friends, including Fanny Price, a poor and determined but talentless art student who does not get along well with people. Fanny Price falls in love with Philip, but he does not know and has no such feelings for her; she subsequently commits suicide. Philip realizes that he will never be a professional artist. He returns to his uncle&#39;s house in England to study medicine and pursue his late father&#39;s field. He struggles at medical school and comes across Mildred, who is working as a waitress in a tea shop. He falls desperately in love with her, and they date regularly, although she does not show any affection for him. Mildred tells Philip she is getting married to another man, leaving him heartbroken; Philip subsequently enters into an affair with Norah Nesbit, a kind and sensitive author of penny romance novels. Later Mildred returns, pregnant, and confesses that the man for whom she had abandoned Philip never married her. Philip breaks off his relationship with Norah and supports Mildred financially, though he can ill afford to do so. To Philip&#39;s dismay, after Mildred has her baby she falls in love with his good friend Harry Griffiths, and runs away with him. About a year later, Philip runs into Mildred again and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in again. Though he no longer loves her, he becomes attached to her baby. When he rejects her advances, she becomes angry with him, destroys most of his belongings, and leaves forever. In shame, and quickly running out of money, Philip leaves the house for good. He meets Mildred once more towards the end of the novel, when she summons him for his medical opinion. As she is probably suffering from syphilis resulting from her work as a prostitute, Philip advises Mildred to give up this life. Mildred declines and exits from the plot, her fate remaining unknown.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWU3NzQ1ZmYtOWZmNi00ZDRlLWI3NTktMWNiMTU4OGZjOWU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDY3MzU2MDM@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Of Human Bondage" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Of Human Bondage is based on the book Of Human Bondage? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">A medical student with a club foot falls for a beautiful but ambitious waitress.
