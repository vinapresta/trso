Through the course of a punishingly hot summer, we experience life with the six children and three adult Veeches as they bicker, brawl, make up, and provide titillating morsels of scandal for the neighborhood.

They live in a down-trodden apartment house, which they share with other working class tenants. Her husband is in a State mental hospital and most likely there for good. Her deadbeat younger brother and a lodger from across the hall pay board to eat in her crowded little flat. As Christmas approaches, there is no money for gifts and no prospect of her husband returning home. As her burden becomes intolerable, Sally's sturdy courage begins to falter. To make matters worse, the sleazy, suspicious owner of the local night club - Nick Toresca - takes a fancy to Sally and won't leave her alone. As he is the brother of her boss at the greasy spoon, she is in no position to call the shots. Things are shaken up when Sally's sister - the swaggering, glamorous, independent Petey Braun - appears on the scene. All loud laugh, deep voice, self-confident aplomb and worldly generosity, Petey grabs the spotlight and centre of the stage and never lets them go. She is an American career woman - one who makes a career of men: she is a master of her trade. To give Sally a break, Petey sets about to dazzle Nick so that he has no eyes for Sally. Nothing is straightforward when Petey gets involved, however, so what follows is a swift-paced tale of tension, excitement and sibling rivalry as the very different worlds of Sally and Petey collide . . .",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WKVN5-2Z1z8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:h,publisher:c,subtitle:g}},{id:11541,attributes:{title:e,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:h,publisher:c,subtitle:g}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069450738}}("movie","Maritta Wolff","Simon and Schuster","series","Whistle Stop",null,"","2008-12-09",1,"The Veech family are trouble-prone. A large and poverty-striken tribe, they live in a small Michigan town on the outskirts of the city. With six children and three adults crowded into an old and ill-kept house, they bicker and brawl within walls that are, quite literally, sagging. Big, handsome, graceless: a drunkard and a wastrel who has never worked, Kenny Veech nevertheless possesses some kind of arrogant charm that makes him irresistible to women. After fawning on him, yearning for him and paying for his drinks, woman after woman is cast out with a cold brutality. For no woman will ever take the place in his heart occupied by his cool, poised and beautiful sister, Mary. Although living quite openly with a wealthy semi-gangster, who helps support the Veech family, Mary reciprocates Kenny's unnatural affection for her. Their twisted, thwarted love provides titillating morsels of scandal for the neighbourhood through the course of a hot and breathless summer. Things reach a head after Mary and her gangster boyfriend get married and it is made clear that there is not enough room for three people in their relationship . . .","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CGMaLof3YbYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
