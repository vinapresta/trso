In this compelling memoir, his first wife, Jane Hawking, relates the inside story of their extraordinary marriage. As Stephen's academic renown soared, his body was collapsing under the assaults of a motor neuron disease. Jane's candid account of trying to balance his 24-hour care with the needs of their growing family reveals the inner strength of the author, while the self-evident character and achievements of her husband make for an incredible tale presented with unflinching honesty. Jane's candor is no less apparent when the marriage finally ends in a high-profile meltdown, with Stephen leaving Jane for one of his nurses and Jane marrying an old family friend. In this exceptionally open, moving, and often funny memoir, Jane Hawking confronts not only the acutely complicated and painful dilemmas of her first marriage, but also the relationship's fault lines exposed by the pervasive effects of fame and wealth. The result is a book about optimism, love, and change that will resonate with readers everywhere.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Kmy5oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2015-01-04",publisher:e,subtitle:"The True Story Behind The Theory of Everything"}},{id:12324,attributes:{title:"Ṭrêvhaliṅga ṭū inphiniṭī",description:"On the life of Stephen Hawking, a physists and his first wife Jane Hawking.",thumbnail:b,authors:[a,"Sudarśana Āṭhavale"],firstBook:d,published:"2012-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:"māya lāipha vitha Sṭīphana"}},{id:12325,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:l,publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:12326,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:l,publisher:e,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703446805}}("Jane Hawking","","movie",null,"Alma Books","series",1,"Travelling to Infinity","Cry to Dream Again","From the number-one bestselling author of Travelling to Infinity: The True Story behind The Theory of EverythingIn 1930s Greater London, Shirley is a talented ballerina who dreams of becoming a principal dancer at the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company.
