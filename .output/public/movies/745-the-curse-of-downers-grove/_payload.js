In the tone of confused brilliance unique to precocious seventeen-year-olds, it tells the story of a girl who knows there must be more to life than hanging out and getting high. But like teenagers everywhere, Chrissie doesn't know what it is, where to find it, or whether she even wants it anyway. Her brother's a junkie, her best friend's sex-crazed, and her mom's about to marry a loser with a gambling jones. Chrissie's own long-term goals are limited: to snag the cute local mechanic and escape a gang of football jocks with mayhem in mind. As she, her friends, and her family struggle to understand each other, Downers Grove paints a searing portrait of the real America -- and the odd, moving moments that redeem even the most imperfect lives.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=fKv3swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1999-07-21",publisher:"William Morrow",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:4806,attributes:{title:c,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:d,publisher:k,subtitle:e}},{id:4807,attributes:{title:"Bongwater",description:"This novel of young slackers in 1990s Portland and New York City is “a swift, exhilarating read [and] a surprisingly sweet-natured love story” (Madison Smartt Bell).

Downers Grove is the haunting and tender story of Chrissie Swanson, a high school senior for whom graduating has become a matter of life or death. She’s an unusual girl in an ordinary town. But when jocks are out to destroy her life in increasingly unsettling ways, and her high school seems to be cursed with a series of untimely deaths, you can’t blame her for being a little paranoid. Meanwhile, her mother’s sex life is overshadowing her own; her brother never leaves the basement; and her best friend Tracy is hornier than a Prince song—all of which leaves her eccentric grandmother as the only source of wisdom in a rapid downward spiral. As Chrissie tries to take control of the events that shape her life, she finds the events taking control of her, until she is finally cornered by choices with everlasting consequences. Full of humor, wit, and the sacrilegious worldview of a savvy teenager, Downers Grove paints a searing portrait of the American dream in all its broken glory.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Xq7SDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc."))
