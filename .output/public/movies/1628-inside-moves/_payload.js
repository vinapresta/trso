Fleeing by car, foot, air, bicycle, train, covered wagon and dirigible, the two make their way with Lily's baby from Sunset Boulevard to a mountain retreat in Oregon. Eluding all manner of physical and mental danger, Lily and Charlie take their final stand with a commune of utopian artists. Their odyssey is seedily realistic, wildly surrealistic, often erotic and only occasionally a bit precious. What seemed like a simple pursuit story has become an engaging parable of the responsibilities of creativity, the nature of self–worth, the redemptive power of love—perhaps the Meaning of Life itself. Night Train evokes a paranoid romanticism reminiscent of Craig Nova, Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon. – Tom Nolan, Los Angeles Times",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jdkREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2012-10-24",publisher:b,subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940967635}}("Todd Walton","Catapult",null,"Inside Moves","","Jerry Maxwell and his good friend Roary are both handicapped. They divide their time between Max's bar in San Francisco and the bleachers of the Oakland Sports Complex to cheer on the Golden State Warriors. Together the two set out to make Jerry's dream of playing professional basketball a reality. Inside Moves is an off–beat, exuberant and extremely emotional novel focusing on the bonds of friendship between two men brought together by physical and psychological challenges, and their dreams of creating more meaningful lives for themselves and their friends. Often classified as a sports novel, basketball is merely the backdrop to this human comedy of love and sorrow and the healing powers of friendship and community. Released to wide critical acclaim by Doubleday in 1978, Inside Moves went on to sell over 160,000 copies through numerous printings. A motion picture of Inside Moves was released in 1980, directed by Richard Donner with a screenplay by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=j9kREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2013-06-05","Buddha in a Teacup","The forty-two short tales that comprise Buddha In A Teacup are set in contemporary America, as opposed to long ago China or India. Each parable springs from the author’s meditations on fundamental aspects of Buddhist dharma as those teaching apply to the world today. Some of the tales are humorous, some sad, some erotic, some mysterious—all linked and balanced by themes of mindfulness, compassion, generosity, kindness and love. The reader need not be a Buddhist or know anything about Buddhism to fully appreciate and enjoy these universal tales of the human condition.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=eN8REAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2016-02-01","Contemporary Dharma Tales"))
