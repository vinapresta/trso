This is the second major film released within a short period with King Charles II as a primary character, and Charles here and Charles (George Sanders) in \"Forever Amber\" are two very varied approaches to the same character. This one takes place prior to the beginning of \"Forever Amber\" when Charles II and his followers are hiding out in Holland from Oliver Cromwell's puritan Round Heads. Being temporarily at liberty (or unemployed), Charles takes a day job at the farm\u002Festate of Katie, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile he eludes his enemies by agility, enterprise and sword play, some of the latter performed while riding the blades of a Dutch windmill. He is summoned back to the throne and has to leave Katie and the tulips behind, returns to England, is replaced by George Sanders who pursues Amber St. Clair and forgets all about Katie. \"The Exile\" and \"Forever Amber\" should be viewed back-to-back for maximum-contrast enjoyment.",slug:"the-exile"}}},books:{data:[{id:5882,attributes:{title:"His Majesty the King",description:"This is a new release of the original 1926 edition.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dM8WnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Cosmo Hamilton"],firstBook:true,published:"2013-10-01",publisher:"",subtitle:"A Romantic Love Chase of the Seventeenth Century"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568460651}}("movie","series",1))
