At her side is her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his aging backwards, being diagnosed with several aging diseases at birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations in Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to read, especially as it relates to the time past this reconnection between Benjamin and Daisy, when Daisy gets older and Benjamin grows younger into his childhood years.",slug:"the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button"}}},books:{data:[{id:4789,attributes:{title:b,description:"A graphic novel adaptation of the classic Fitzgerald short story about a man who ages backwards after being born an old man in Baltimore in 1860.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ZbNvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Nunzio Defilippis",c],firstBook:true,published:e,publisher:a,subtitle:"A Graphic Novel"}},{id:4790,attributes:{title:b,description:"\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" is one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's most memorable short stories. The protagonist, Benjamin Button, is born an old man and ages in reverse until he becomes a baby and then finally vanishes from the earth. In a short introduction to the story, Fitzgerald wrote: \"This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's 'Note-books.' \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" was the inspiration for the major motion picture of the same name and remains one of Fitzgerald's most haunting and beautiful tales. This collection also includes three other Jazz Age tales by Fitzgerald.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TeUiteJECD8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:"Coyote Canyon Press",subtitle:a}},{id:4791,attributes:{title:"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Stories",description:"Although better known today for his novels, in the 1920s F. Scott Fitzgerald ranked among the top writers of magazine fiction. Fitzgerald represented the dreams and aspirations of the post-World War I generation in his life as well as his works. With his glamorous wife, Zelda, and his cosmopolitan social circle, he projected the perfect image for narrating tales of restless youth in a hectic world. These short stories offer insights into many themes, characters, and techniques that emerged in Fitzgerald's later works. The title tale, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" reflects his preoccupation with life's fleeting nature. \"Winter Dreams,\" written three years before The Great Gatsby, shares the concept of commitment to an idealized dream. \"Babes in the Woods,\" developed during the author's Princeton days, evidences the roots of This Side of Paradise. Thirteen other selections offer further insights into the author's growing skills as well as examples of his sparkling prose, understated wit, and deft characterizations.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=EC3RDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2020-03-18",publisher:"Courier Dover Publications",subtitle:a}},{id:4792,attributes:{title:"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=N5iozQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["F Scott Fitzgerald"],firstBook:d,published:"2020-07-22",publisher:a,subtitle:"By F Scott Fitzgerald Books Paperback"}},{id:4793,attributes:{title:b,description:"Born an old man, Benjamin Button lived a very curious life, backwards When Benjamin Button's father arrives at hospital he is surprised and ashamed to find his new baby boy is a weathered, aged man, for all appearances no younger than seventy years old.
