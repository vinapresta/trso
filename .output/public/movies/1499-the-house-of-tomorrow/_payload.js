Why? Because Jonah was the boy she knew only through texts and emails but understood to his very core. Jonah was the only boy she’d told she loved and the only boy to say it back. And Jonah was the boy whose suicide she never saw coming. Jonah’s death has sent Tess pinwheeling into grief and confusion. But even though he’s gone, Tess still writes to him. She wants answers to the yawning chasm of questions that’s become her life. At the same time, she’s trying to find solace in her father’s alternative funeral business. Who knew that arranging last rites for prized pets could be so life-affirming? But love, loss, and life are so much more complicated than Tess ever thought . . . especially after she receives a message that turns her already inside-out world totally upside down. As funny as it is heartbreaking and completely unputdownable, Things I’m Seeing Without You shows us what it means to love someone, to lose someone, to wade through the beautiful\u002Fstrange agony of the aftermath, and somehow love again. \"Sometimes hilarious, always affecting.\" --VOYA \"Nails the messiness of grief.\" --SLJ \"Compelling . . . a draw for fans of Nicola Yoon.\" --BCCB",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KZbUDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:"2017-10-03",publisher:b,subtitle:c}},{id:1108,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:o,publisher:b,subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703573886}}("Peter Bognanni","Penguin","","movie",null,"The House of Tomorrow","series",1,"* \"Funny and unique . . . An honest, noisy, and raucous look at friendship and how loud music can make almost everything better.\" --Publishers Weekly, starred review Sebastian Prendergast lives with his eccentric grandmother in a geodesic dome. His homeschooling has taught him much-but he's learned little about girls, junk food, or loud, angry music. Then fate casts Sebastian out of the dome, and he finds a different kind of tutor in Jared Whitcomb: a chain-smoking sixteen-year-old heart transplant recipient who teaches him the ways of rebellion. Together they form a punk band and plan to take the local church talent show by storm. But when his grandmother calls him back to the futurist life she has planned for him, he must decide whether to answer the call-or start a future of his own.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=mFhbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2018-07-03","This Book Is Not Yet Rated","In this enormously funny, smart, and moving contemporary YA novel, fighting for the thing you love doesn't always turn out like in the movies. \"Hilarious, big-hearted, poignant...An unadulterated triumph.\" --Jeff Zentner, author of The Serpent King Movies have always helped Ethan Ashby make sense of the world. So when developers swoop in and say the classic Green Street Cinema is going to be destroyed to make room for luxury condos, Ethan is ready for battle. And so a motley crew of cinema employees comes together to save the place they love: There's Sweet Lou, the elderly organist with a penchant for not-so-sweet language; Anjo, the too-cool projectionist; Griffin and Lucas who work concessions, if they work at all; and Ethan, their manager (who can barely manage his own life). Still, it's going to take a movie miracle for the Green Street to have a happy ending. And when Raina Allen, Ethan's oldest friend (and possible soul mate?), comes back to town after working in Hollywood--cue lights and music--it seems that miracle may have been delivered. But life and love aren't always like in the movies. This Book is Not Yet Rated is about growing up, letting go, and realizing love hides in plain view--in the places that shape us, the people who raise us, the first loves who leave us, and the lives that fade in and fade out all around us. \"A beautifully written look at first love and first loss.\" --Julie Buxbaum, author of What to Say Next \"Film aficionados and fans of John Green will especially like this one.\" --Booklist, starred review \"It pulls you in, holds you...A funny and moving winner.\" --Adi Alsaid, author of Never Always Sometimes \"I cannot get over how much I love this book.\" --Jared Reck, author of A Short History of the Girl Next Door \"[A] sweet love story with a quest at its heart.\" --PW \"Reel[s] you in...Absorbing...quirky and fun.\" --VOYA","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=qkdkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2019-04-09"))
