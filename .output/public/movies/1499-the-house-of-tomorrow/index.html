Why? Because Jonah was the boy she knew only through texts and emails but understood to his very core. Jonah was the only boy she’d told she loved and the only boy to say it back. And Jonah was the boy whose suicide she never saw coming. Jonah’s death has sent Tess pinwheeling into grief and confusion. But even though he’s gone, Tess still writes to him. She wants answers to the yawning chasm of questions that’s become her life. At the same time, she’s trying to find solace in her father’s alternative funeral business. Who knew that arranging last rites for prized pets could be so life-affirming? But love, loss, and life are so much more complicated than Tess ever thought . . . especially after she receives a message that turns her already inside-out world totally upside down. As funny as it is heartbreaking and completely unputdownable, Things I’m Seeing Without You shows us what it means to love someone, to lose someone, to wade through the beautiful/strange agony of the aftermath, and somehow love again. &quot;Sometimes hilarious, always affecting.&quot; --VOYA &quot;Nails the messiness of grief.&quot; --SLJ &quot;Compelling . . . a draw for fans of Nicola Yoon.&quot; --BCCB</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb1108"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qkdkDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book This Book Is Not Yet Rated" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>This Book Is Not Yet Rated</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Peter Bognanni<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Penguin</span><span><span> - </span>4/9/2019</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>In this enormously funny, smart, and moving contemporary YA novel, fighting for the thing you love doesn&#39;t always turn out like in the movies. &quot;Hilarious, big-hearted, poignant...An unadulterated triumph.&quot; --Jeff Zentner, author of The Serpent King Movies have always helped Ethan Ashby make sense of the world.
