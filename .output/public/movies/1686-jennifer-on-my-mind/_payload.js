Lasch may have understated it. 35 years later, in the Obama era—with its parade of endless, often inexplicable, scandals—we have a full blown epidemic of what has recently been called Moral Narcissism. Forget Narcissus and his reflection, Moral Narcissism—the almost schizophrenic divide between intentions and results now pervading our culture—is the new method for feeling good about yourself. It no longer matters how anything turns out as long as your intentions were good, that you were “moral.” And, just as importantly, the only determinant of those intentions, the only one who defines that morality, is you. I Know Best goes beyond Lasch to lay bare how this moral narcissism is behind all those scandals from Obamacare to the Veteran's Administration to the IRS, Benghazi, Bergdahl, Syria and beyond. Everything the Obama administration did and does was about making them feel good about themselves—the results be damned. And they have as their allies those supreme moral narcissists in the academy, media and Hollywood, ever willing to ratify those good intentions and ignore those same results. But I Know Best is not just about the Left. Moral Narcissism affects the right as well, even when they don’t realize it. It is a true epidemic that must be cured in order to save our democratic republic and our futures.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=H48fDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:b,published:"2016-06-14",publisher:d,subtitle:"How Moral Narcissism Is Destroying Our Republic, If It Hasn't Already"}},{id:8724,attributes:{title:"Raising the Dead",description:"Detective Moses Wine, hired to clear a terrorist Arab organization of murder, finds himself in his homeland, Israel, with a cast of eccentric religious leaders, terrorists, and politicians with which to contend, and a beautiful girlfriend by his side",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VvUhtHM4QeAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[i],firstBook:b,published:"1988-01-01",publisher:j,subtitle:j}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703554380}}("movie",null,"Roger L.
