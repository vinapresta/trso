Julia Packett (Greer Garson), a London chorus girl, is always in trouble financially, but she always seems to manage to land on her feet by using her feminine wiles to manipulate the men in her life with a smile on her and usually their faces. Much to her surprise, Julia receives an invitation to her now grown daughter Susan Packett's (Dame Elizabeth Taylor's) wedding to upper crust Roderick Pennystone to be held in the Packett mansion outside of Paris. Julia being a wife and mother is something of which her current social circle had no idea. Julia and her equally upper crust husband William Sylvester Packett (Walter Pidgeon) met during World War I when he was enlisted and she a bright-eyed seventeen-year-old just starting out in the vaudeville business. They split - separated, but never divorced - because of their fundamental class and thus attitudinal differences when Susan was just an infant. Julia knew that it made sense to leave Susan with William because Julia's working life, which included late nights and often being on the move to where the work is located, would be no way to raise Susan. However, William's controlling mother, in the settlement, would not allow Julia any visitation rights, as such, Susan has never known her mother. Despite having no money for the trip nor appropriate wedding attire, Julia accepts the invitation, which Mrs. Packett (Lucile Watson), William, and Susan are surprised to receive as no one admits to sending Julia an invitation, she not on the official invitation list. Julia's presence adds a spark to the proceedings as she is reunited with William, and as she gets to know Susan for the first time, all of which is only complicated by her encounter with the Ghenoccio acrobatic troupe en route to Paris, strongman Fred Ghenoccio (Cesar Romero), who has fallen in love with her, and the presence of William's old friend, the wealthy Colonel Bruce (Willowbrook Nigel Bruce), known to his friends as \"Bunny\". But Julia hopes that, based on her history and current circumstance with William, she has some influence on Susan, who she feels is marrying the wrong man, she seeing Ritchie Lorgan (Peter Lawford), the Packett's hired bohemian muralist, as the person Susan truly loves if she will only open her eyes to the fact.",slug:"julia-misbehaves"}}},books:{data:[{id:8844,attributes:{title:f,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:k,publisher:c,subtitle:l}},{id:8845,attributes:{title:m,description:n,thumbnail:o,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:p,publisher:c,subtitle:q}},{id:8846,attributes:{title:f,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:k,publisher:c,subtitle:l}},{id:8847,attributes:{title:m,description:n,thumbnail:o,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:p,publisher:c,subtitle:q}},{id:8848,attributes:{title:f,description:e,thumbnail:e,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1940-01-01",publisher:e,subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568456493}}("Margery Sharp","movie","Open Road Media",null,"","The Nutmeg Tree","series",1,"In 1930s France, a free-spirited mother undertakes to derail her very proper daughter’s engagement Julia Packett has barely laid eyes on her daughter, Susan, since leaving her with her well-heeled in-laws following the loss of her husband in World War I.

At her mother-in-law’s vacation villa in Haute Savoie, however, Julia sees that her priggish but lovely daughter is completely mismatched with a man much more suited to herself: a charming, clever playboy. The arrival of Susan’s legal guardian, the distinguished Sir William Waring, further complicates the situation. Soon Julia’s efforts to pass herself off as a lady and secure her daughter’s happiness spin out of control, leading to romantic entanglements and madcap adventures that will challenge preconceived notions about the ultimate compatibility of any two people who fall in love.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ZCmfCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2016-04-12","A Novel","The Margery Sharp Collection Volume One","Four charming, witty novels—including The Nutmeg Tree—from the “highly gifted” New York Times–bestselling author of Cluny Brown (The New Yorker). A master of the twentieth-century comedy of manners, British author Margery Sharp has been praised as “one of the most gifted writers of comedy” (Chicago Daily News) and “a wonderful entertainer” (The New Yorker). Available for the first time in a single volume, this quartet of novels provides a shining example of “her brilliantly acerbic fiction . . . [and] one of her greatest talents, creating female characters of toughness and complexity” (The New York Times). Something Light: In 1950s London, professional dog photographer Louisa Datchett has decided it’s high time she snared herself a husband. Up until now, she’s been indiscriminately fond of men, who’ve taken shocking advantage of her good nature. At age thirty Louisa is ready for someone to take care of her and sets out on her romantic quest, in this New York Times bestseller. “Brisk, bright, sly, engaging . . . a pleasure to read.” —Chicago Tribune The Nutmeg Tree: Motherhood was never really free-spirited Julia Packett’s thing. Following the loss of her husband in World War I, Julia turned to her well-heeled in-laws to raise her daughter. Now twenty, Susan invites her mother to France for the summer to persuade her grandmother to allow her to marry. When Julia arrives, she quickly sees that her proper daughter is mismatched with a playboy. And when Susan’s distinguished legal guardian, Sir William Waring, shows up, romantic complications ensue. “Original, subtle, and consistently entertaining.” —Kirkus Reviews The Flowering Thorn: In 1929 London, socialite Lesley Frewen impulsively decides to adopt an orphaned boy. Moving to the tiny village of High Westover, Lesley finds herself challenged by a whole new way of life and changed by a young boy who begins to awaken her capacity to love. “To those who ‘discovered’ Margery Sharp with The Nutmeg Tree, the reissue of this earlier novel . . . will be good news. The city-bred-country-won theme is handled with gay humor and enough of sentiment for general appeal.” —Kirkus Reviews The Innocents: As World War II separates a three-year-old, mentally challenged girl from her parents, a British spinster takes on the responsibility of raising her and the two grow closer. But when the war is over and the girl’s mother returns, Antoinette doesn’t want to be separated from the only person who’s ever really understood her. “Marvelously crafted . . . believable and heart-wrenching . . . [Sharp] is an incredibly perceptive writer.” —The Literary Sisters","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GOdVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2018-04-24","Something Light, The Nutmeg Tree, The Flowering Thorn, and The Innocents"))
