So what if she's overstressed and overscheduled: She's got school covered. (Lifeâ€”not so much.) Ms. Pitt is the kind of teacher who wants you to call her by her first name and puts all the chairs in a circle and tells her students to feel their book reports. Hadley wishes Ms. Pitt would stick to her lesson plan. Ms. Pitt wishes Hadley would lighten up. So when Hadley and Ms. Pitt find themselves switched into each other's bodies, the first thing they want to do is switch right back. It takes a family crisis, a baffled principal, and a (double) first kiss to help them figure out that change can be pretty enlightening.
