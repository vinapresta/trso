They have been fortunate that they have never had to send them on their missions.

The best at tradecraft. The best at weapons handling. The best at analyzing a volatile situation, getting in, getting what they came for, and getting out alive. They are all dead-their old identities perished when they were kidnapped by the secret masters of the institute. Now they have new names and new personal histories. More important, each has received a life-saving organ transplant. And something else-twice a day, each is given an injection of a mysterious golden serum. They are no longer ordinary human beings. Their minds are linked in a bond that grows stronger with time. Their leader is known as Denny Monroe. He doesn't trust anyone associated with the St. John Institute-especially not Charlotte Willson, who oversees the transplant project. Since the five agents are already dead, Monroe figures they're seen as expendable-and he's going to do whatever is necessary to protect himself and his four colleagues. Half a world away, a Russian general, desperate to escape his country's failing economy and crumbling military, sells five small atomic bombs-suitcase nukes-to an international terrorist. He's paid a staggering sum that allows him to ignore the death and destruction the bombs will inevitably cause. But General Temkov can't quite sleep peacefully at night. His best spy has vanished in the U.S. under suspicious circumstances. Kidnapping an Americana diplomat in Moscow, Temkov pressures the CIA to reveal the whereabouts of his missing man. But the CIA knows nothing. The first suitcase nuke destroys a small African city-a test of the equipment. Three more bombs are on their way to London, Jerusalem, and Washington, D.C. The CIA is convinced that the missing spy and the missing bombs are somehow connected. But to find out exactly what is going on, they need Denny Monroe and his band of extraordinary telepaths. Monroe has needs of his own-to determine the identity of the mysterious \"Kelly's People.\" Are they his team, or does the St. John Institute guard even more secrets?

Every one of them believes he is the American whose papers he carried, and every one of them has been programmed to destroy a target in the United States. The trigger is a coded phone message.

And Die Hard 2 made it happen—doubling down on the explosive action. And just like the original blockbuster, the sensational sequel leaped from the pages of a suspense master’s pulse-pounding novel... A massive blizzard has shut down nearly every East Coast airport, stranding travelers on the ground and in the air. But those circling the skies above New York’s Kennedy Airport have far more to worry about than missed connections. When the control tower’s radar suddenly goes dark, a mysterious caller known only as “Number One” announces that the countdown to terror has begun. Nineteen planes, and their helpless passengers, are now airborne hostages—in the ruthless hands of a dangerous man on a deadly mission. And if the U.S. government doesn’t bow to his demands, hell will rain from above as one jetliner after another exhausts its fuel... and plunges to earth. With only 58 minutes between life and death, there may be nothing anyone can do...except one New York City cop, with nerves of steel, attitude to burn, and a reputation for being hard on crime—and even harder to kill.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WnDg-yMO3_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2013-02-18",publisher:"Graymalkin Media",subtitle:c}},{id:12192,attributes:{title:"Time of Reckoning",description:"A breakneck thriller by the author of 58 Minutes, the basis of the blockbuster film Die Hard 2.
