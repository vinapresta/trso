This quest ends up being not quite what he envisioned as he does require the assistance of others to find his footing, and in turn, he amasses friends and acquaintances along the way, some who become more a part of his life than he would have imagined. Perhaps most importantly, some of those people provide him with the knowledge of how to co-exist with some of the many Indian tribes, most importantly the Crow, on whose land in Colorado Jeremiah ultimately decides to build his home.

This critically acclaimed novel, which was first published in 1943, forms part of author Vardis Fisher’s Testament of Man, the moving and unforgettable chronicle of mankind’s long journey from cave to civilization. WERE THEY MEN...OR ANIMALS? They lived in family groups, as men do. Yet the female was always taken by force, as animals do. They walked upright, as men do. Yet they fought with their teeth and nails, ripping at each other’s flesh, as animals do. These strange and violent people belong to the bloodstained and bestial past of every one of us. These are the first men and women—more of a jungle animal than a human being...and ancestors to all of us. ‘The most ambitious project of the imagination in present-day fiction’—The New York Herald Tribune ‘One of the most brutal and disturbing novels ever written’—The Chicago Daily News ‘It is moving art...worthy of a Dostoievsky.’—William K.

He had drunk fully of the blood of the animal he had killed and now the animal’s warmth and power surged within him. He felt hungry for a woman and turned to Memes—tall, broad of hip, with a full, voluptuous bosom—and he led her into the cave. She did not resist. He embraced her violently. His breathing sounded as if he were strangling. The others turned from their work to watch....
