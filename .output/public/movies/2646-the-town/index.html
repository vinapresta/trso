Four masked men—thieves, rivals, and friends from the tough streets of Charlestown—take on a Boston bank at gunpoint. Holding bank manager Claire Keesey hostage and cleaning out the vault were simple. But career criminal Doug MacRay didn&#39;t plan on one thing: falling hard for Claire. When he tracks her down without his mask and gun, their mutual attraction is undeniable. With a tenacious FBI agent following his every move, he imagines a life away from his gritty, dangerous work—a life centered around Claire. But before that can happen, Doug and his crew learn that there may be a way to rob Boston&#39;s venerable baseball stadium, Fenway Park. Risky yet utterly irresistible, it would be the perfect heist to end his criminal career and begin a new life. But, as it turns out, pursuing Claire may be the most dangerous act of all. Racing to an explosive climax, Prince of Thieves is a brash tale of robbery in all its forms—and an unforgettable odyssey of crime, love, ambition, and dreams.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div></section><section><h2 class="bg-trso-blue text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-center font-serif px-4 mb-2">Related books / From the author(s)</h2><div class="flex flex-wrap"><!--[--><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12663"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=b2PW4CJb4RkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Prince of Thieves" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Prince of Thieves</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Chuck Hogan<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Simon and Schuster</span><span><span> - </span>8/10/2004</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>From the author of The Strain comes a tense, psychologically gripping, Hammet award-winning thriller.

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert &#39;Gloansy&#39; Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug&#39;s mother ran off and Doug&#39;s father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James&#39; single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she&#39;s told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI&#39;s lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">7.5/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">92%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">74/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Prince of Thieves, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
