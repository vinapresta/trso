Students of philosophy, theology, religion, and ministry, as well as others interested in engaging postmodernism and the emerging church phenomenon, will welcome this provocative, non-technical work.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=71unRvDgxAMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["John D.
