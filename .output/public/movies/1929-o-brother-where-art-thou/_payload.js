Fox invites the reader into a life so full-from his mother dressing him up in women's clothing to his father coercing him into medical school; his search for belonging in the \"families\" of academia, publishing, beatniks and hipsters, Latin America, transsexuals, Judaism, and his own progeny; and the seemingly-glamorous whirlwind world of the arts and culture-that it leaves little else to be desired. Originally from Chicago, Fox studied culture intensely and traveled widely becoming thoroughly Latinized by early adulthood. Much of Fox's life was shaped by his international interests-from his publishing and academic careers to his personal tastes and selection in women-which factored largely into his career successes and personal adventures. Never one to be content with the average or mundane, Fox keeps the pace moving with one exciting revelation or humorously self-interested remark after another. The picture of self-awareness-and -actualization?-Fox's question of Who, Me? has not so much to do with the author\u002Fpoet\u002Fscholar he's become as it does with how he evolved into this multifaceted character of his own creation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tUWPZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Hugh Fox"],firstBook:true,published:"2011-06-12",publisher:"Sunbury Press, Incorporated",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:9699,attributes:{title:"Exile's Return",description:"The adventures and attitudes shared by the American writers dubbed \"The Lost Generation\" are brought to life here by one of the group's most notable members.

These relate to the plot and to the range of the poet's passionate feeling. The story line has the makings of a high suspense love drama, but the author wants, more crucially, to explore his thoughts on a myriad of topics in what feels like verse journaling - moody, mercurial, unpredictable, and intense. That's why the genre of the narrative hovers between a play and what we'd now call a psychological novel. Complicating both the dramatic tension and the introspective depth is the bisexual range of the poet's passionate temperament. The fact that his boyfriend and mistress are attracted to each other will account for some of the strong conflicts in the speaker's mind. But the wild oscillations of his feeling toward each of them are also rooted in his widely receptive sexual nature. I'm a dialogic poet, carrying on a long tradition of friendly rivalry among verse writers. Here I undertake a book-length dialogue in sonnets with Shakespeare. The best way to respond to a poem that won't let go of you is to write another poem and try to make it worthy of the first. Often I sum up a lyric from a new perspective. Or I'll respond with parallel or contrasting memories and imaginings of my own. Poets, philosophers, mythic figures, musicians, or novelists may enter my replies. Psychological sidelights will be many. The possibilities revealed by the genre of lyrical response appear unlimited. There's no better con-verse-ation partner than Shakespeare, who gave me a deep love for his favorite lyric form. Entering into it, I assumed a stranger-self, and it made a stranger me.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BNyzjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Martin P.
