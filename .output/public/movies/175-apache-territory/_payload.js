From the jungles of Borneo to the hidden canyons of the American West, from small-town fight clubs to a Parisian café at the end of World War II, here are tales of betrayal and revenge, courage and cowardice, glory and greed, as only Louis L’Amour can tell them. Here is L’Amour at his very best: A charismatic boxer itches to fight all comers—but his only shot at the championship is in beating the man who ruined his father. . . . A beautiful movie star finds a dead man in her apartment and begs her ex-lover, a tough private eye, to clear her name. . . . A reluctant hero guides a diamond-hunting couple up a river ruled by headhunters and pirates in pursuit of a legendary stone and the mysterious warlord who guards it. . . . A young renegade sails the South China Sea with a trio of dangerous men in search of treasure, but when it’s time to divide the prize, can he trust any of them? Combining electrifying action scenes, vivid historical detail, and characters who seem to leap off the page, these spectacular stories honor the legend of Louis L’Amour. Louis L’Amour’s Lost Treasures is a project created to release some of the author’s more unconventional manuscripts from the family archives. In Louis L’Amour’s Lost Treasures: Volumes 1, Beau L’Amour takes the reader on a guided tour through many of the finished and unfinished short stories, novels, and treatments that his father was never able to publish during his lifetime. L’Amour’s never-before-seen first novel, No Traveller Returns, faithfully completed for this program, is a voyage into danger and violence on the high seas. These exciting publications will be followed by Louis L’Amour’s Lost Treasures: Volume 2. Additionally, many beloved classics will be rereleased with an exclusive Lost Treasures postscript featuring previously unpublished material, including outlines, plot notes, and alternate drafts. These postscripts tell the story behind the stories that millions of readers have come to know and cherish.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bUhvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2018-10-02",publisher:d,subtitle:"Stories"}},{id:2479,attributes:{title:"The Collected Short Stories of Louis L'Amour, Volume 2",description:"With more than 120 titles still in print, Louis L'Amour is recognized the world over as one of the most prolific and popular American authors in history.

So Logan Cates naturally headed for Papago Wells. But he wasn’t the only one. Fleeing the fierce Churupati and his Apache warriors, other travelers had come there too. And when the Apaches found them, they began a siege as relentless and unforgiving as the barren land…and just as inescapable. The last thing Cates wanted was to be responsible for the lives of thirteen desperate strangers and a shipment of gold. But he knew that if they were to survive, he was their last chance. He also knew that some in the party were willing to die—or kill—to get their hands on the money. If he couldn’t get them to work together, it wouldn’t be the desert or even the Apaches that would do them in—it would be the greed of the very people he was trying to save.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SVrnEBASqaUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2004-02-03","A Novel"))
