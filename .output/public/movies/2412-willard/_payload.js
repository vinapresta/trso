M. Forster \"[A]n unusual, talented book with many good things in it. [...] Stephen Gilbert is an interesting writer, whose material is out of the ordinary run of things.\" - Anthony Powell Marcus Brownlow was a strange and imaginative young schoolboy whose dreams sometimes foretold the future. Now he's nineteen, unemployed, directionless, and not ready to grow up. An unexpected invitation from a school friend to visit him at the house of his eccentric millionaire uncle Mr. Burnaby seems to hint at adventure and a change of fortune. But what Marcus doesn't know is that Mr. Burnaby wants his help in a series of strange experiments whose ultimate goal is to discover what happens to the soul after death. What begins as harmless fun as Mr. Burnaby teaches Marcus how to project his spirit out from his body quickly becomes more sinister, and may lead to a horrible fate even more terrifying than death. . . . Stephen Gilbert (1912-2010) is best remembered for his novel \"Ratman's Notebooks\" (1968), twice filmed as Willard, and for his friendship as a young man with the much older novelist Forrest Reid. \"The Burnaby Experiments\" (1952) is a brilliant and unclassifiable novel, part fantasy, part science fiction, part horror, and partly a thinly veiled and blackly humorous fictionalization of Gilbert's difficult relationship with Reid. This first-ever reprinting of Gilbert's scarce novel coincides with its 60th anniversary and features the original jacket art by legendary book designer Berthold Wolpe.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HsVtHQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2012-12-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"An Account of the Life and Work of John Burnaby and Marcus Brownlow"}},{id:11669,attributes:{title:"Bombardier (Valancourt 20th Century Classics)",description:"Stephen Gilbert (1912-2010) is best remembered today for his fantasy and horror novels, including \"The Landslide\" (1943), which featured a talking dragon and sea serpent, \"Monkeyface\" (1948), centering on an super-intelligent ape, and \"Ratman's Notebooks\" (1968), the best-selling novel about killer rats that inspired several films. Given his background as an imaginative novelist, it is perhaps surprising that Gilbert also authored one of the most realistic and authentic novels to emerge from World War II, \"Bombardier\" (1944). A success when first published, Gilbert's novel is a lightly fictionalized account of his own experiences in the 3rd Ulster Searchlight regiment in France in 1940, in the period leading up to the military disaster that ended in the Dunkirk evacuation. Narrated from the point of view of a young and ingenuous enlisted man, Lance-Bombardier Peter Rendell, and written in Gilbert's characteristically elegant prose, \"Bombardier\" is a fascinating account of a major event in 20th-century history. \"A writer of distinction.\" - E. M. Forster \"Dramatic, at times exciting, and always admirably written.\" - Forrest Reid \"The tremendous events of the retreat to Dunkirk, the bombing of the town, and the sinking of their ships ... Mr. Gilbert has done quite a good job.\" - \"The Guardian\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=oLWsDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2016-05-17",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377214068}}("","Stephen Gilbert","movie",null,"series",1,"Willard","Ratman's Notebooks"))
