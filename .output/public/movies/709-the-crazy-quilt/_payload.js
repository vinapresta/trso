Stimulating, wise, and elegant, The Illusionless Man speaks as eloquently now as it did on its first publication in 1966. \"This is a beautifully written statement of a philosophy which will please and uplift, both by its bittersweet aphoristic quality and the solidity of its message.\" -George Adelman, Library Journal",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YqOTWNjWDGUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"2000-01-01",publisher:"Other PressLlc",subtitle:"Fantasies and Meditations on Disillusionment"}},{id:4636,attributes:{title:d,description:f,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VbMbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:null,published:"1971-01-01",publisher:f,subtitle:"Fantasies and Meditations"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568426296}}("movie","series",1,"The Illusionless Man","Allen Wheelis",""))
