In the first four Fantasies, the illusions of love, memories, work, and death are exposed, while in the two concluding Meditations, Wheelis writes intimately as a psychoanalyst about the illusions of his chosen profession. Stimulating, wise, and elegant, The Illusionless Man speaks as eloquently now as it did on its first publication in 1966. \"This is a beautifully written statement of a philosophy which will please and uplift, both by its bittersweet aphoristic quality and the solidity of its message.\" -George Adelman, Library Journal",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YqOTWNjWDGUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2000-01-01",publisher:"Other PressLlc",subtitle:"Fantasies and Meditations on Disillusionment"}},{id:4636,attributes:{title:a,description:c,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VbMbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:null,published:"1971-01-01",publisher:c,subtitle:"Fantasies and Meditations"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940950037}}("The Illusionless Man","Allen Wheelis",""))
