He tells a convincing, satisfying, and un­usual story even when employing stock Western situations. A major strength is his understanding of the nuances of char­acter, of how people are motivated, of the good and bad within each person, and of the conflicts between man and his en­vironment. Drawing upon his years in the mountains of Colorado, he can viv­idly and realistically depict a variety of Western settings and do so in such a way that the settings assume a character of their own. The eerie Big Ghost Basin of “The Fire Killer,” the high mountain country of “My Brother Down There,” and the vast northern plains of “Great Medicine” confront us through his descriptions.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lRoeAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:h,published:"1984-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069566658}}("","movie","series","Steve Frazee",1,"Gold of the Seven Saints","1961-01-01",null))
