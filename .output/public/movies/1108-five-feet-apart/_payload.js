Hanya satu yang tak bisa dia kendalikan, yaitu penyakit fibrosis kistik yang membuatnya sering keluar-masuk rumah sakit. Yang harus Stella lakukan adalah terpisah dua meter dari siapa pun atau apa pun yang mungkin bisa menularkan infeksi, yang mungkin membuatnya tercoreng dari daftar transplantasi paru-paru. Tidak ada perkecualian. Sebentar lagi Will Newman akan berusia delapan belas tahun. Itu berarti dia punya kendali atas dirinya sendiri. Satu-satunya hal yang ingin Will kendalikan adalah keluar dari rumah sakit, bukannya terkungkung selamanya di sana. Dia tidak peduli terhadap rangkaian perawatan penyakit fibrosis kistik dan uji coba obat klinis yang harus dia jalani. Will merupakan sosok yang jelas-jelas harus Stella jauhi. Begitu Will berada di dekat Stella, gadis itu bisa kehilangan tempat dalam daftar transplantasi paru-paru. Bahkan, salah satu dari mereka bisa mati . Satu-satunya cara agar mereka tetap hidup adalah dengan menjaga jarak. Namun, terpisah dua meter terasa seperti hukuman bagi mereka.
