Bu tin one major respect it differs from other stories which vividly re-create exciting and meaningful events in the past: the difference is that we, of today, made the history of which this story grew. We know there were men in the American Army like Sergeant Dondolo and Major Willoughby, for whom World War II was chiefly a once-in-a-lifetime chance to feather their own nests in characteristic though quite dissimilar fashions. There were also unimaginative, methodical good eggs like Corporal Ambramovici, tired, honest, and frustrated officers like Colonel DeWitt, and flamboyant brass like General Farrish. And any one of us might have been Lieutenant David Yates, torn between his loyalty to his wife at home and his passion for a French girl, trying to determine, in the welter of conflict, whether he was involved in a Crusade or a Conquest. We might not know so well Sergeant Bing, fighting against his former countrymen, for whom the war was surely a personal crusade. Men, and often women, are the theme of this novel. The story lies in the development of people, especially of Bing and Yates, under the intensified emotions of war. Some of the people are connected with a Propaganda Intelligence Unit, some with an Armored Division; others are civilians on our side and on the enemy’s. “...Unquestionably the most important fiction to come out of World War II...only a writer of understanding and sympathy, combined with creative artistry, can clothe his characters in flesh and blood—and that is exactly what Heym has done.”—Capt.
