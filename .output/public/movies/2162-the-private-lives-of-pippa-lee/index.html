She&#39;s the devoted wife of Herb, a brilliant and successful older publisher, the proud mother of successful twins, and a lovely and adored friend and neighbour. She and her husband may have cast off Gramercy Park for Marigold Village (&quot;Wrinkle Village,&quot; they say), but they have done so in the spirit of mature anticipation of oncoming old age and a serene new chapter of life. In Pippa&#39;s life, however, change is occurring under the surface and it seems unreal: &quot;More and more, the past was flooding into her, mingling with the present like water poured into water.&quot; The truth is that this lovely and loving woman has a past of grit, deceit, and betrayal. In her reckless youth, she managed to have an affair with a teacher, run away from home, get heavily involved with drugs, and be set adrift into the wilds of New York-until, unexpectedly, she manages to find love and create a family of her own.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb10676"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=OdobCDYMJ4AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Jacob&#39;s Folly" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Jacob&#39;s Folly</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Rebecca Miller<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux</span><span><span> - </span>3/5/2013</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>A luminous novel-funny and moving in equal measure-that shines with the author&#39;s unique talents Jacob&#39;s Folly is a rollicking, ingenious, saucy book, brimful of sparkling, unexpected characters, that takes on desire, faith, love, acting-and reincarnation. In eighteenth-century Paris, Jacob Cerf is a Jew, a peddler of knives, saltcellars, and snuffboxes. Despite a disastrous teenage marriage, he is determined to raise himself up in life, by whatever means he can. More than two hundred years later, Jacob is amazed to find himself reincarnated as a fly in the Long Island suburbs of twenty-first-century America, his new life twisted in ways he could never have imagined. But even the tiniest of insects can influence the turning of the world, and thanks to his arrival, the lives of a reliable volunteer fireman and a young Orthodox Jewish woman nursing a secret ambition will never be the same. Through the unique lens of Jacob&#39;s consciousness, Rebecca Miller explores change in all its different guises-personal, spiritual, literal. The hold of the past on the present, the power of private hopes and dreams, the collision of fate and free will: Miller&#39;s world-which is our own, transfigured by her clear gaze and by her sharp, surprising wit-comes brilliantly to life in the pages of this profoundly original novel.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb10677"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qTS-lPSMOucC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Personal Velocity" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Personal Velocity</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Rebecca Miller<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Canongate Books</span><span><span> - </span>7/2/2009</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>‘An excellent book’ Guardian ‘Compelling’ Independent The vibrantly fresh and lustrous stories in Miller&#39;s collection explore the multifaceted lives of women in seven arresting portraits. Modern and diverse, these women of different classes and ages struggle with sexuality, fate, motherhood, infidelity, desperation, and an overriding will to survive. We meet Greta, a cookbook editor who is chosen by Tavi, the hottest writer of his generation, to edit his new book; Paula, a pregnant twenty-one-year-old, who is on the run; Delia, an abused working-class wife who goes into hiding with her children; and Louisa, a painter who moves rapidly from one lover to the next, acting out a self-perpetuating drama over which she has no control. Edgy, fearless, and beautifully spare, Personal Velocity is a superb collection from one of the best writers in contemporary fiction.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMTcxMjQyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUyODI4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster The Private Lives of Pippa Lee" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is based on the book The Private Lives of Pippa Lee? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Pippa Lee feels dislocated when she and her husband Herb move from Manhattan to a retirement community. He&#39;s older than she, they have two children who are young adults, and the daughter hardly speaks to Pippa. Pippa tells us about her life, in long flashbacks, starting with her birth to a mom who was a social dynamo and addicted to pills. As a teen, Pippa moves out and lives a hippie life until meeting Herb, who was then married to a young siren. Pippa discloses tragedies and discoveries. In the present, she&#39;s sleepwalking at night and talking from time to time with a burned-out case, the 35-year-old son of a neighbor.
