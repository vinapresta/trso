She's the devoted wife of Herb, a brilliant and successful older publisher, the proud mother of successful twins, and a lovely and adored friend and neighbour. She and her husband may have cast off Gramercy Park for Marigold Village (\"Wrinkle Village,\" they say), but they have done so in the spirit of mature anticipation of oncoming old age and a serene new chapter of life. In Pippa's life, however, change is occurring under the surface and it seems unreal: \"More and more, the past was flooding into her, mingling with the present like water poured into water.\" The truth is that this lovely and loving woman has a past of grit, deceit, and betrayal. In her reckless youth, she managed to have an affair with a teacher, run away from home, get heavily involved with drugs, and be set adrift into the wilds of New York-until, unexpectedly, she manages to find love and create a family of her own.",thumbnail:e,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2008-01-01",publisher:e,subtitle:e}},{id:10676,attributes:{title:"Jacob's Folly",description:"A luminous novel-funny and moving in equal measure-that shines with the author's unique talents Jacob's Folly is a rollicking, ingenious, saucy book, brimful of sparkling, unexpected characters, that takes on desire, faith, love, acting-and reincarnation. In eighteenth-century Paris, Jacob Cerf is a Jew, a peddler of knives, saltcellars, and snuffboxes. Despite a disastrous teenage marriage, he is determined to raise himself up in life, by whatever means he can. More than two hundred years later, Jacob is amazed to find himself reincarnated as a fly in the Long Island suburbs of twenty-first-century America, his new life twisted in ways he could never have imagined. But even the tiniest of insects can influence the turning of the world, and thanks to his arrival, the lives of a reliable volunteer fireman and a young Orthodox Jewish woman nursing a secret ambition will never be the same. Through the unique lens of Jacob's consciousness, Rebecca Miller explores change in all its different guises-personal, spiritual, literal. The hold of the past on the present, the power of private hopes and dreams, the collision of fate and free will: Miller's world-which is our own, transfigured by her clear gaze and by her sharp, surprising wit-comes brilliantly to life in the pages of this profoundly original novel.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OdobCDYMJ4AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2013-03-05",publisher:f,subtitle:g}},{id:10677,attributes:{title:"Personal Velocity",description:"‘An excellent book’ Guardian ‘Compelling’ Independent The vibrantly fresh and lustrous stories in Miller's collection explore the multifaceted lives of women in seven arresting portraits.

We meet Greta, a cookbook editor who is chosen by Tavi, the hottest writer of his generation, to edit his new book; Paula, a pregnant twenty-one-year-old, who is on the run; Delia, an abused working-class wife who goes into hiding with her children; and Louisa, a painter who moves rapidly from one lover to the next, acting out a self-perpetuating drama over which she has no control.

The devoted wife of a brilliant publisher thirty years her senior, the proud mother of successful twins, and a lovely and adored friend and neighbor, she seems to glow with feminine serenity. But when her husband spontaneously decides they should cast off Gramercy Park for Marigold Village retirement home as a \"preemptive strike against his decrepitude,\" Pippa finds her beatific persona unraveling in alarming ways: the truth is that the gracious woman of the present day has seen more than her fair share of the wild side. By seventeen, Pippa had lived with a Dexedrine-addicted mother, felt the first stirrings of sexuality with a school girlfriend, had an affair with a teacher, and run away from home, set adrift on a course littered with broken hearts—until she seemingly found love and security in a family of her own. And now that established world, too, is in danger. In Pippa Lee we have an unforgettable heroine, and a quirky and acutely intelligent portrait of the many lives behind a single name. Even after we've read it, The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is a story that is still unfurling.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Xz_GWO0YjoEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2008-08-05"))
