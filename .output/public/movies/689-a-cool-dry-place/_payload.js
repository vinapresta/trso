He never actually swallows it, just places loose clumps onto his tongue and sucks, I think....He knows better, my son, but he is still young and needs to be watched.\" So goes the poignant journey of discovery for Gordon Nash, a journey that began two years ago when his wife suddenly walked out on him, leaving him alone to raise their son. Calvin is now four, fragile yet stubborn, devoted to his pet, a dead Portuguese man-o-war he calls Mom. Faced daily with the struggle and joys of raising this bright little boy, Gordon learns the vast reaches of his affection and the limits of his patience. He plumbs the deep well of rage within himself, to find there disturbing echoes of his own father. And he comes to understand that nothing is as important as this complex, imperfect love--a lesson he must turn to when his wife reappears one day, threatening to turn his and Calvin's world upside down once again.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JOSq6ILAJl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1996-04-25",publisher:"Macmillan",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:4593,attributes:{title:"Definitive Guide to Excel VBA",description:"- Kofler's book offers more up-to-date coverage than other books on the market - Provides in-depth coverage of topics normally overlooked, such as the File Scripting Objects, accessing external databases using the ADO library, automating data analysis with pivot tables, and automating diagrams.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=E0Z81iknpMUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Michael Kofler"],firstBook:d,published:"2008-01-01",publisher:"Apress",subtitle:b}},{id:4594,attributes:{title:"When Blackness Was a Virtue",description:"During grim economic times, a divorced father's grip on morality loosens as he tries to provide for his young daughters.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JuhPmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2014-01-28",publisher:b,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377266557}}("movie","","Michael Grant Jaffe",null,"series",1,"Dance Real Slow"))
