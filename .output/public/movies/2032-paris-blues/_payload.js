On the night of October 1, 1943, the Nazi boot kicked open doors in rooms largely empty. Only a fraction of the Danish Jews — 472 — were caught and sent to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp (where 53 of them died). The remaining 7,500 escaped — thanks to one German and several thousands of their countrymen. How? That was the question that puzzled the American journalist and television-writer, Harold Flender... He returned to Denmark for intensive research among rescuers and rescued and in archives. This book is the result... Flender brings out the risks and agonies, the drama and the heroism, in straight, professional reporting...
