They used to own the land on which they now sharecrop, they believing Kiser Pease stealing it from them in he paying the back taxes which Roy Luther failed to pay. Devola, the romantic, took over the domestic duties of the household following her mother's passing. However, in Roy Luther knowing of his own imminent passing due to his poor health, he instructs fourteen year old Mary Call, as the practical one - as practical as a fourteen year old can be - to take over his role in the family following his passing, including not to call in any figure of authority in his distrust, and not to allow Devola to marry Kiser, who is sweet on her and Devola who would say yes if left to her own devices. Mary Call takes the directive literally in not informing anyone of authority of their father's passing in fear that she and her siblings would be separated in the foster care system. Trying to hide Roy Luther's death becomes difficult as more and more people want to speak to him, including Kiser in his continuing pursuit of Devola. But Mary Call has to decide how far to honor Roy Luther's dying wishes as she struggles to keep everything together, and as she herself is pulled in other directions.",slug:"where-the-lilies-bloom"}}},books:{data:[{id:11474,attributes:{title:c,description:"An Appalachian girl, the eldest of an orphaned family attempts to preserve her pride in the face of abject poverty and interfering neighbors.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lt0tagkOxZgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,e],firstBook:true,published:"1991-03-01",publisher:"HarperCollins Publishers",subtitle:a}},{id:11475,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=6NOD7tUQ0MYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,e,"Celeste Raspanti"],firstBook:d,published:"1977-01-01",publisher:"Dramatic Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:11476,attributes:{title:c,description:"In the Great Smoky Mountains region, a fourteen-year-old girl struggles to keep her family together after their father dies.",thumbnail:a,authors:[b,e],firstBook:d,published:"1974-01-01",publisher:"Scarborough, Ont. : New American Library",subtitle:a}},{id:11477,attributes:{title:"Weekly Reader Children's Book Club Presents Where the Lilies Bloom",description:"In the Great Smoky Mountains region, a fourteen-year-old girl struggles to keep her family together after her father dies.",thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1969-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:11478,attributes:{title:"Moon Lake Angel",description:"Kitty Dale, whose mother does not want to deal with a child, or admit one into her new life, spends the summer with Aunt Petal and eventually learns to accept her mother's weaknesses.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Bo39fYG3T10C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:"Lothrop Lee & Shepard",subtitle:"A Novel"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940926454}}("","Vera Cleaver","Where the Lilies Bloom",null,"Bill Cleaver"))
