Jack can save his pre-teen son Andrew, literally in his arms, but his wife and two daughters are among the slaughter victims. Western governments seem unwilling to go after the fiends, even hiding the identity of a high-profile victim. Although now a single father, Jack uses all his contacts and snooping skill to seek the truth himself. A London-based Serbian free newspaper editor sets him on the trail of four Balkanic killers, but is murdered. Jack decides to exact revenge himself, tipped-off by Sûreté-contact Duguay.
