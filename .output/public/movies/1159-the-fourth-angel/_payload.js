But their US airplane is hijacked in Limassol (Cyprus) by the unknown August 15 terrorist movement, which ends up in a bloodbath. Jack can save his pre-teen son Andrew, literally in his arms, but his wife and two daughters are among the slaughter victims. Western governments seem unwilling to go after the fiends, even hiding the identity of a high-profile victim. Although now a single father, Jack uses all his contacts and snooping skill to seek the truth himself. A London-based Serbian free newspaper editor sets him on the trail of four Balkanic killers, but is murdered. Jack decides to exact revenge himself, tipped-off by Sûreté-contact Duguay. Meanwhile US embassy official Davidson and FBI Special Agent Jules Bernard play a key part in the official, MI5-lead investigation, which ends up crossing Jack's path.",slug:"the-fourth-angel"}}},books:{data:[{id:6518,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IBMNjmTEW8UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:true,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:6519,attributes:{title:"The London Connection",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KFDx4a8AUlQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:b,published:"1991-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:6520,attributes:{title:"Newspaper Clippings from the Cullman, Alabama Democrat 1924 - 1929",description:"The Cullman Democrat was established in 1901 Its circulation soon grew to match that of the most successful Alabama weekly newspapers.
