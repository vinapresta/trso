Richard Hume Werking explores both the methods and the motives of these \"master architects.\" Unlike other scholars, Werking finds that the foundations and general structure of the United States foreign service emerged before World War I. He sees its development as prompted less by foreign crises than by economic conditions—particularly the need to stimulate export trade. Indispensable to its growth were the dedicated efforts of bureaucrats who were loyal to national interests but wished the opportunity to do interesting work and to receive recognition when they did it well.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GeMzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Richard Hume Werking"],firstBook:d,published:"2021-12-14",publisher:"University Press of Kentucky",subtitle:"Building the United States Foreign Service 1890–1913"}},{id:10218,attributes:{title:"THE BOOK OF PIRATES: 70+ Adventure Classics, Legends & True History of the Notorious Buccaneers",description:"Enjoy the best sea adventures, treasure hunt tales and bloody battles, along with learning the truth behind the legends, the real life stories that inspired so many writers and produced so many beloved classics: History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates (Captain Charles Johnson) The Book of Buried Treasure Treasure Island (R.
