Author Luke Short (born Frederick Dilley Glidden, 1908-1975) was born in Kewanee, Illinois. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for two and a half years and then transferred to the University of Missouri at Columbia to study journalism. Following graduation, he worked for a number of newspapers before becoming a trapper in Canada. He later moved to New Mexico to be an archeologist's assistant. After reading Western pulp magazines and trying to escape unemployment, he began to write Western fiction. He sold his first short story and novel in 1935 under the pen name of Luke Short (which was also the name of a famous gunslinger in the Old West, although it's unclear if he was aware of that when he assumed the pen name.) His apprenticeship in the pulps was comparatively brief. In 1938 he sold a short story, \"The Warning,\" to Collier's and in 1941 he sold his novel Blood on the Moon (aka Gunman's Chance) to The Saturday Evening Post.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OGAbzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2020-11-20",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:3237,attributes:{title:g,description:"An Indian-fighting officer carries on, facing danger and risking disgrace...",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DZ_0AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2012-07-26",publisher:"Wildside Press LLC",subtitle:a}},{id:3238,attributes:{title:"Marauders' Moon",description:"A captured outlaw gets caught up in a bloody range war in this thrilling tale of the Old West from a Levi Strauss Golden Saddleman Award–winning author. Lawbreaker Webb Cousins is headed for a short trial and a long stretch in jail. A bounty hunter has him cuffed and covered, with no chance of escape. But when the prisoner and his captor ride into the town of Wagon Mound, death rides with them. In a flash of rifle fire and a spray of blood, Cousins finds himself shackled to a dead man—and unwittingly caught up in a murderous range war he wants nothing to do with. To ride away a free man will take more than breaking his bonds. He’ll have to wage a one-man battle against two bitter enemies locked in a vicious cycle of vengeance and cruelty. It will take every ounce of cunning, a double shot of courage, and a long, dark ride into hell for Cousins to finally break free. Luke Short, along with such legendary authors as Zane Grey and Louis L’Amour, helped transform the stories of the American West from dime-store pulp into an immensely popular literary genre. Marauders’ Moon is one of his grittiest and most suspenseful stories of western adventure.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=XwgXDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2016-11-01",publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:3239,attributes:{title:"Bounty Guns",description:"Hired to find a killer, a drifter rides into a deadly family feud, in this action-packed novel from an award-winning storyteller of the West. For $10,000, Tip Woodring must ride into a frontier town full of murderers and find one particular killer. The deal—offered by Rig Holman, a saloon owner who liked the way Woodring knocked out a nasty drunk in front of his bar—could make him a fortune . . . or cost him his life. Last spring, a prospector named Blackie Mayfell walked into Holman’s office with $15,000 in gold and a strange proposition. He asked Holman to keep the money and get it to his daughter if he died, handing over a little extra for insurance. Then Mayfell was slain by someone who wanted a piece of his claim. Holman wants to know who pulled the trigger, and Woodring will find out—or die trying.
