Bob does not like the idea of being at the mercy of work colleagues, most, like Dodgson, who he did and does not know. In private, he confides to his father, widowed businessman and retired Navy officer Frank Jones, that part of his want to leave the job, which also entails eavesdropping on private conversations between Soviet officials on a multitude of everyday topics, is that he believes the British, and by association Americans, are just as corrupt as the Russians in how they infiltrate institutions most of the public see as commonplace, this belief to which conservative, patriotic Frank takes offense. After a specific incident, Bob wants to use that whistle blowing policy to report against the operations of the GCHQ, but not knowing to whom. Shortly thereafter, Frank learns that Bob has died from an apparent fall off of his building roof. Frank begins to think that Bob's death was not an accident, but has something to do with whatever Bob was planning on exposing. Knowing no one in high places, Frank, with Bob's girlfriend Cynthia Goodburn helping, goes on a mission of discovery, at his own peril, to find out why his son was killed, which may forever change his view of what he has believed in all his life.",slug:"the-whistle-blower"}}},books:{data:[{id:11532,attributes:{title:g,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=qD6gl1D2DOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["John Hale"],firstBook:true,published:"1988-09-01",publisher:"Collier Books",subtitle:a}},{id:11533,attributes:{title:e,description:"One of the most important novels of the early twentieth century, John Fox Jr.'s The Trail of the Lonesome Pine is a sweeping historical epic that is much more than the sum of its many parts.
