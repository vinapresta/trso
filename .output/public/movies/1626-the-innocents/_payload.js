In The Turn of the Screw, a governess is haunted by ghosts from her young charges past; Virginia Woolf said of this masterpiece of psychological ambiguity and suggestion, We are afraid of something unnamed, of something, perhaps, in ourselves...Henry James...can still make us afraid of the dark. In his rarely anthologized novella In the Cage, James brings his incomparable powers of observation to the story of a clever, rebellious heroine of Britain's lower middle class. Hortense Calisher, in her Introduction, calls it a delicious story, the more so because it confounds what we expect from James.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kEpl0x-iYUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2012-08-22",publisher:"Modern Library",subtitle:b}},{id:8437,attributes:{title:"The Turn of the Screw and Other Short Fiction",description:"Classic tales of terror by the nineteenth-century American writer illustrate his observation of interpersonal relationships",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HcmM3YIz5kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"1981-01-01",publisher:"Bantam Classics",subtitle:b}},{id:8438,attributes:{title:"The Turn of the Screw By Henry James",description:"The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=G8azAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2014-05-08",publisher:"BookRix",subtitle:b}},{id:8439,attributes:{title:"The Turn of the Screw and Other Stories",description:"In 1898, Henry James wrote a novella that would become one of the most famous and critically discussed ghost stories ever written, The Turn of the Screw. Three other examples of James’s tales of the supernatural, “The Altar of the Dead,” “The Beast in the Jungle,” and “The Jolly Corner,” are included in this edition. These texts reveal on both the thematic and narrative levels James’s deepest concerns as a writer. The texts in this edition are all drawn from the New York Edition of James’s works. The introduction traces the extensive critical debate around The Turn of the Screw, and situates the texts in contemporary discussions of the supernatural. Appendices include material on the tales’ reception, James’s writings on the supernatural, and the study of the supernatural in the nineteenth century.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7s93qZGigKcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2010-05-07",publisher:"Broadview Press",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940967668}}("Henry James","",null))
