It is now eleven years and 3,000 miles later, and the couple live in Westchester County, a suburb of New York City, with their two young sons, whom they are educating at home. Through no accident, a continent now stands between them and the boys' surviving grandparent, now known as Nan, but who in former days answered to Mrs. Robinson. As the story opens, the Braddock household is in turmoil as the Westchester School Board attempts to quash the unconventional educational methods the family is practising. Desperate situations call for desperate remedies - even a cry for help to the mother-in-law from hell. She is only too happy to provide her loving services - but at a price far higher than could be expected. Charles Webb has a knack for pinpointing the horrors and absurdities of domestic life, and Home School displays all the precision and wit that made The Graduate such a long-lasting success..",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=94G0jL_5JqYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2008-09-04",publisher:"Random House",subtitle:a}},{id:994,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"[novel]"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377337205}}("","The Graduate","Charles Webb","movie",null,"series",1,"The novel about an aimless young man in 1960s America that inspired the classic film: “Moves with the speed and drive of a runaway locomotive.” —Chicago Sunday Review When Benjamin Braddock graduates from a small eastern college and comes home to his parents’ house, everyone wants to know what he’s going to do with his life. Benjamin has no idea. Feeling empty, embittered, and adrift, he stumbles into an affair with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father’s business partner. But then he falls in love with a woman closer to his own age: Mrs. Robinson’s daughter. A scathingly entertaining tale of idealism and materialism, corruption and conformity, The Graduate is both a darkly comic love-triangle tale and a sharp look at postwar suburbia. “He contrives some ludicrously funny situations and he keeps his story racing.” —The New York Times Book Review “His novel makes you want to laugh and it makes you want to cry.” —The Plain Dealer","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lcQpAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2014-01-09","RosettaBooks"))
