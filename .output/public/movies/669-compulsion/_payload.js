They have few true friends as they believe all their contemporaries are intellectually inferior. Within their relationship, Artie is the dominant and Judd the submissive who says he will do whatever Artie tells him. Although Judd acts intellectually arrogant to others, he also shows signs of weakness and reticence most evident to Artie. Part of their goal in life is to experience how it feels to do everything. As such, they plot to commit what they consider the perfect crime - a kidnapping and murder - not only so that they can experience the sense of killing for killing's sake, but also taunt the law with the knowledge of it and their superiority after the fact. They believe their crime is above the law. Their murder of young Paulie Kessler is not so perfect, with evidence at the scene uncovered by one of their law school colleagues, Sid Brooks, who also works for the Globe newspaper. As Artie and Judd try to manipulate their way out of how the evidence may implicate them, their manipulation ultimately backfires and they are charged with the murder. The most famed trial lawyer in town, Jonathan Wilk, is hired to defend the pair despite his atheism being against the families' sensibilities. Jonathan, renowned for his ability to manipulate juries, has to decide how best to defend his clients in the overwhelming face of evidence against them. The testimony of Ruth Evans, Sid's girlfriend, may have some impact on the trial's outcome.",slug:"compulsion"}}},books:{data:[{id:4500,attributes:{title:b,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}},{id:4501,attributes:{title:b,description:"Oggi ricostruire fatti di sangue è diventato un intrattenimento di massa – più o meno l'unico, si direbbe. Ma c'è stata un'epoca non lontana, e peraltro abbastanza sanguinaria, in cui l'assassinio gratuito di un ragazzo da parte di due suoi coetanei veniva presentato, sulle prime pagine di tutti i giornali, come «Il delitto del secolo». Accadde a Chicago, negli anni Venti. Due ricchi studenti ebrei, Nathan Leopold e Richard Loeb (che qui si chiamano Judd Steiner e Artie Straus), avevano progettato un delitto perfetto, ma come chiunque indulga a questo genere di fantasticheria finirono per commettere un imprevedibile errore, che li mise rapidamente al centro di un clamoroso processo. Fu un caso che affascinò per decenni i migliori appassionati del crimine, ispirando a Hitchcock \"Nodo alla gola\", e a Meyer Levin questa travolgente indagine, che diventa via via una superba costruzione romanzesca, dove, come in un grande film classico, protagonisti e comprimari – avvocati, reporter, psicoanalisti – fanno fino in fondo, come meglio non si potrebbe, la loro parte.

They celebrate their \"perfect crime\" in a nightclub, with their girlfriends and a fraternity brother, who happens to be a reporter. Tracing of a pair of glasses dropped at the scene of the crime leads the reporter to an interrogation of the two \"supermen\" in a cat-and-mouse scene, in which they flaunt their extravagant ideas, but eventually entangle themselves. Their bizarre crime arouses a lynching fever, and, in the face of this, a humanitarian attorney fights for their lives. Questions of juvenile delinquency, capital punishment and psychiatric evidence are the subject of the courtroom battle. The struggle over the fate of the two boys is waged between the defense attorney, who believes that we are fallible creatures trapped in our mortal imperfections, and the prosecuting attorney who contends that all men must be held responsible for their actions and punished for their crimes, whatever the causes might be.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lP1ZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"1959-01-01",publisher:d,subtitle:"A Play"}},{id:4503,attributes:{title:b,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}},{id:4504,attributes:{title:b,description:d,thumbnail:d,authors:["Kelli M.

Artie is handsome, athletic, and popular, but he possesses a hidden, powerful sadistic streak and a desire to dominate. Judd is a weedy introvert, a genius who longs for a companion whom he can idolize and worship. Obsessed with Nietzsche’s idea of the superhuman, both boys decide to prove that they are above the laws of man by arbitrarily picking and murdering a Jewish boy in their neighborhood. This new edition of Meyer Levin's classic literary thriller Compulsion reintroduces the fictionalized case of Leopold and Loeb – once considered the \"crime of the century\" – to a new generation. This incisive psychological portrait of two young murderers seized the imagination of an era and is generally recognized as paving the way for the first non-fiction novel. Compulsion forces us to ask what drives some further into darkness, and some to seek redemption. Heartbreaking as it is gripping, Compulsion is written with a tense and penetrating force that led the Los Angeles Times to call Levin, “the most significant Jewish writer of his times.”","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=4RLlCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2015-04-14","Fig Tree Books","A Novel"))
