He manages to get a job at Kelsey's Boat Yard because an accident caused by Kelsey Bunker's no-good son, Junior, endangered Bud's life and revealed his excellent war record. He does well at the job, but Joe Pettigrew (NOT PLAYED by Gig Young), personnel manager of the cannery, is jealous of Lou's feeling for Bud. He frames Bud for a robbery committed by himself and Junior Bunker.
