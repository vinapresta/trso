Dorothy may have defeated the Wicked Witch of the West and returned home to Kansas, but all is not well for those who remain in the Land of Oz. In L. Frank Baum’s second Oz novel, readers are introduced to poor orphan boy Tip, who has been raised by nasty Wicked Witch Mombi. Finally escaping Mombi’s clutches after years of cruelty, Tip is joined by his enchanted companions, Jack Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse, on an adventure unlike anything they’ve ever experienced—and more dangerous than they could’ve imagined. The Emerald City—once ruled by the kindly Scarecrow—has been taken over by the mean General Jinjur and her all-girl Army of Revolt. Fleeing the fallen city, Scarecrow and Tip’s band venture off to ask the Tin Woodman and Glinda the Good Witch for help. But they soon learn that the only one who can truly save the Emerald City is the last rightful heir to the throne of Oz: a princess who was hidden away long ago. Now Tip and his loyal friends must find the lost princess before all of Oz is lost . . .",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=R94nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2017-07-04",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:b}},{id:11856,attributes:{title:g,description:"Table of Contents Tip Manufactures a Pumpkinhead The Marvelous Powder of Life The Flight of the Fugitives Tip Makes an Experiment in Magic The Awakening of the Saw-horse Jack Pumpkinhead's Ride to the Emerald City His Majesty the Scarecrow Gen.
