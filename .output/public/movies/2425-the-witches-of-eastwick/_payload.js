After their latest conversation lamenting about the lack of suitable men in Eastwick and describing the qualities they are looking for in a man, mysterious Daryl Van Horne and his equally mysterious butler Fidel arrive in town. Despite being vulgar, crude, brazen and not particularly handsome, Daryl manages to be able to tap into the innermost emotions of the three friends, and as such manages to seduce each. In turn, the three women blossom emotionally and sexually. After an incident involving one of the town's leading citizens, the ultra conservative Felicia Alden, the three women begin to understand how and why Daryl is able to mesmerize them so fully. The three decide to experiment with some powers learned indirectly from Daryl so that they can hopefully regain control of their own lives.",slug:"the-witches-of-eastwick"}}},books:{data:[{id:11730,attributes:{title:b,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:i}},{id:11731,attributes:{title:b,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:i}},{id:11732,attributes:{title:b,description:"Alexandra, Jane, and Sukie ply their individual witcheries in contemporary Eastwick, Rhode Island, and are themselves bewitched by a dark, wealthy, decadent stranger",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BntbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Michael Cristofer","Tessler, Yvonne Fair",c],firstBook:d,published:"1984-01-01",publisher:"Alfred a Knopf Incorporated",subtitle:a}},{id:11733,attributes:{title:"Myth and Gospel in the Fiction of John Updike",description:"Big on style, slight on substance: that has been a common charge over the years by critics of John Updike. In fact, however, John Updike is one of the most serious writers of modern times. Myth, as Myth and Gospel in the Fiction of John Updike shows, unlocks his fictional universe and repeatedly breaks open the powerful themes in his literary parables of the gospel. This book also includes a personal tribute to John Updike by his son David, essays by pioneer Updike scholars Alice and Kenneth Hamilton, and an anecdotal chapter in which readers share Updike discoveries and recommendations. All in all, weight is added to the complaint that the master of myth and gospel was shortchanged by the Nobel committee.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=z9XYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["John McTavish"],firstBook:d,published:"2018-10-25",publisher:"ISD LLC",subtitle:a}},{id:11734,attributes:{title:"The Witches of Eastwick\u002FJohn Updike",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1985-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940921520}}("","The Witches of Eastwick","John Updike",null,"“John Updike is the great genial sorcerer of American letters [and] The Witches of Eastwick [is one of his] most ambitious works. . . . [A] comedy of the blackest sort.”—The New York Times Book Review Toward the end of the Vietnam era, in a snug little Rhode Island seacoast town, wonderful powers have descended upon Alexandra, Jane, and Sukie, bewitching divorcées with sudden access to all that is female, fecund, and mysterious. Alexandra, a sculptor, summons thunderstorms; Jane, a cellist, floats on the air; and Sukie, the local gossip columnist, turns milk into cream. Their happy little coven takes on new, malignant life when a dark and moneyed stranger, Darryl Van Horne, refurbishes the long-derelict Lenox mansion and invites them in to play. Thenceforth scandal flits through the darkening, crooked streets of Eastwick—and through the even darker fantasies of the town’s collective psyche. “A great deal of fun to read . . . fresh, constantly entertaining . . .
