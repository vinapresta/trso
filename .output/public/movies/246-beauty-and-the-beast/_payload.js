Its first published version was written by French author Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve in the middle 18th century. It was a novel-length story intended for adult readers and addressing the issues of the marriage system of the day in which women had no right to choose their husband or to refuse to marry. The best-known version of the tale appeared sixteen years later. Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont simplified and shortened the Villeneuve's work and published it in a magazine for young ladies. The new abridged version became more successful, and Madame de Beaumont is regarded now as the author of the classic story. This edition includes remarkable illustrations by Walter Crane. Crane's work in children's books in cooperation with the publisher Edmund Evans earned him worldwide fame in the late 19th century.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WaEKnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Jeanne-Marie Le Prince De Beaumont"],firstBook:e,published:"2013-06-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:g,attributes:{title:"Beauty And The Beast",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=poeSCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Jeanne-Marie","Le Prince De Beaumont"],firstBook:e,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:"Om Books International",subtitle:"Om Illustrated Classics"}},{id:2753,attributes:{title:d,description:"\"Beauty and the Beast\" by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont.
