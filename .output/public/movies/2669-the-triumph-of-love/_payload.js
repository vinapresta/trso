In the tightly-structured, erotically-charged fable The Triumph of Love, a young princess, conscious that her claim to the throne is less than honourable, disguises herself as a man in order to dupe her enemies and persuade the rightful ruler to return. This faithful and vivid translation by Braham Muray and Katherine Sand was first performed at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 2007. In The Game of Love and Chance, a pair of prospective lovers each swap places with their servants, while their relatives, fully apprised of both deceptions, look on in amusement. Neil Bartlett's adaptation, first performed at the Lyric Hammersmith, finds inventive modern equivalents for Marivaux's ludic theatricality and its roots in the Commedia dell'Arte.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tNP7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Pierre de Marivaux","2007-04-18","Bloomsbury Publishing","The Triumph of Love; The Game of Love and Chance"))
