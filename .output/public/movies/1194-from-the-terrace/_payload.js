Best known for the now-classic 1934 novel Appointment in Samarra and such blockbuster bestsellers as Ten North Frederick and Butterfield 8, in a career spanning four decades John O'Hara also published numerous story collections. Among his finest work, they highlight qualities that sold more than 15 million copies of his books in the course of his career: the snappy dialogue, the telling detail, the ironic narrative twist. Like the novels, and like the much-praised collection of John O'Hara's Gibbsville stories, also edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, the selections in John O'Hara's Hollywood, many originally appearing in the New Yorker or the Saturday Evening Post, explore the materialist aspirations and sexual exploits of flawed, prodigally human characters for whom arrangements consitute a deal and compromises pass for love.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iuBlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2007-01-01",publisher:"Da Capo Press, Incorporated",subtitle:a}},{id:942,attributes:{title:"Selected Stories",description:"These are refreshingly frank, sparely written stories that expose the world of bartenders and b-girls, car washers and criminals.

First published by the Modern Library in 1956, Selected Short Stories of John O'Hara displays the author's skills as a keen social observer, a refreshingly frank storyteller, and a writer with a brilliant ear for dialogue. \"The stories in this volume,\" writes Louis Begley in his new Introduction, \"show the wide range of [O'Hara's] interests and an ability to treat with a virtuoso's ease characters and situations from any place on America's geographic and social spectrum.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=t4gqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1956-01-01",publisher:"Random House Incorporated",subtitle:a}},{id:944,attributes:{title:g,description:"Chronicles the events of Alfred Eaton's life against his successful career in MacHardie and Company and the Department of the Navy--Novelist.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tKM3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1958-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568482057}}("","John O'Hara","movie",null,"series",1,"From the Terrace"))
