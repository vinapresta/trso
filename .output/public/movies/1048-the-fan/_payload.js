Most White Sox fans have taken in a game or two at U.S. Cellular Field, have seen highlights of a young Frank Thomas, and remember the team's 2005 World Series championship. But only real fans remember which player once took his pants off after sliding into first base, can name the opposing outfielder who was showered with beer during the 1959 World Series, or remember who hit the most home runs onto the roof of old Comiskey Park. This is the ultimate resource guide for true fans of Chicago's South Side team, whether a die-hard booster from the days of Billy Pierce or a new supporter of Paul Konerko and Chris Sale.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=K9L0AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Bob Vanderberg"],firstBook:c,published:"2014-04-01",publisher:"Triumph Books",subtitle:a}},{id:6059,attributes:{title:"David's Mother",description:"Dramatic Comedy \u002F Characters: 3 male, 5 female Scenery: Interior The award winning author of 6 Rms Riv Vu, The Fan and Kate & Allie delves into the nature of laughter and pain in this, his most telling play.

The original Broadway production enjoyed a run of 964 performances. The story of the cohabitation of Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison translated extremely well to the silver screen, and then in 1970 to television, where it brought weekly laughs and mirth to an even larger audience for five seasons in prime time. This thorough history details The Odd Couple in all its forms over the decades.
