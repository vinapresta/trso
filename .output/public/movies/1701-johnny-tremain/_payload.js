As compelling today as it was fifty years ago, to read this riveting novel is to live through the defining events leading up to the American Revolutionary War. Fourteen-year old Johnny Tremain, an apprentice silversmith with a bright future ahead of him, injures his hand in a tragic accident, forcing him to look for other work. In his new job as a horse-boy, riding for the patriotic newspaper, the Boston Observer, and as a messenger for the Sons of Liberty, he encounters John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Dr. Joseph Warren. Soon Johnny is involved in the pivotal events shaping the American Revolution from the Boston Tea Party to the first shots fired at Lexington. Powerful illustrations by American artist Michael McCurdy, bring to life Esther Forbes' quintessential novel of the American Revolution.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kQKx7tomrfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Esther Hoskins Forbes"],firstBook:d,published:"1998-10-26",publisher:"HarperCollins",subtitle:a}},{id:8745,attributes:{title:b,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[c,h],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:i,subtitle:a}},{id:8746,attributes:{title:"Johnny Tremain, a Novel for Old and Young... by Esther Forbes...",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940963786}}("","Johnny Tremain","Esther Forbes",null,"1943-01-01","After injuring his hand, a silversmith's apprentice in Boston becomes a messenger for the Sons of Liberty in the days before the American Revolution.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=h7YqYBUWdOcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Gary D Schmidt","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"))
