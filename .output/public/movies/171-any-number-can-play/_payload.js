After a doctor secretly diagnoses him with a severe heart condition and recommends that if he continues to subject himself to the daily stress of a professional gambler, he hasn't long to live. Later that day he's made to realize that he's been neglecting his faithful wife for years and abdicated his duties as father to his son, who resents his father's unsavory reputation and rebuffs his interest in attending that night's prom. Charley's weakling brother-in-law, who sponges off him by freeloading at home and cheating him out of petty cash as croupier, agrees to conspire with rival gamblers to cheat Charley out of thousands. Among the others who add stress to what would seem to be Charley's last night in the casino are a rich former girlfriend who proposes they renew their relationship, an old nemesis who's vowing to break the bank at the tables, and an old degenerate gambler and former mentor whose desperation leads him to try to take his own life.",slug:"any-number-can-play"}}},books:{data:[{id:2456,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2w0yAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:"New York London, Harper & brothers [1945]",subtitle:a}},{id:2457,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Richard Brooks",b],firstBook:d,published:"1948-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:2458,attributes:{title:"The Big Bet",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:a,subtitle:"(Any Number Can Play)"}},{id:2459,attributes:{title:"We are the Robbers",description:"Self-destruction in the glamorized setting of Manhattan and Hollywood, this novel tells the story of Carol Macbeth, wealthy, beautiful and with potentialities as a writer, as she moves through a maze of Broadway, Plaza, Greenwich Village settings and friends, cocktails and more cocktails.
