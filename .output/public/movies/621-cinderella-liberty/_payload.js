In this novel, Ponicsan writes about his pocket of Lantenengo County as he remembers it from his boyhood. He asks his mother to fill in the gaps in his memory and to comment on how things have changed over the years. She volunteers much more information and her letters are reproduced throughout the book. They provide still another focus of the novel itself. Ponicsan chronicles with precise economy the converging lives of the weird but lovable residents of Andoshen: the odd relationship between Shakey the Cop and Thunder Przwalski, town ne'er-do-well; the trouble between Ella Bistricky of Ella’s Lunch and her brother-in-law, R.K., who took five years to get over Rita Hayworth; the love affair between Estelle Wowak. a wrapper-leaf stripper at the cigar factory, and the Reader; the exploits of Duncan, who once gave Willie Mosconi a good game; of Kayo Mackey, who was the only boy ever to hurt Gene Tunney; of Eggshell Oechsle, a primitive existentialist; of Stump Bonomo, Champion of the Tri-County Finger League; of Doc Rice, reluctant dentist; of Jake the Fake, Gyp the Blood, Lemonears Behind the Brewery, and the rest of the boys at Brolly's Bar and the Majestic Pocket Billiards. Andoshen, Pa. is the touching story of a tough, often violent, coal town entirely undermined and sinking more rapidly than the jewel of the Adriatic. The poverty of Andoshen is as rich as that of Tortilla Flat or Cannery Row. It is a new and unique addition to the literary map of the world. DARRYL PONICSAN brings to this novel the same curious, compassionate irony that made his other books, The Last Detail and Goldengrove, so highly acclaimed.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jHeoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[g],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:a}},{id:4280,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Mark Rydell",g],firstBook:d,published:"1963-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377256540}}("","Cinderella Liberty","movie",null,"1000-01-01","Speaking Volumes","Darryl Ponicsan","series",1,"Author of THE LAST DETAIL and LAST FLAG FLYING We first meet John Baggs, YN 2, U.S. Navy, soaking his very sore backside in a sitz bath at sea, aboard the USS Begonia. This is Baggs' second enlistment. He's an unlikely sailor—onetime physics major, possible minister—but the Navy's a lot preferable to science or the pulpit, despite its absurdities, and he can still enjoy the pleasure of sins he wasn't willing to re­nounce. Then came the day he presented his ail­ment to the ship's doctor and was told he needed surgery and a thirty-day stay at the Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Vir­ginia. Not for John Baggs a conventional hospitalization, discharge, and return to duty. In the ultimate bureaucratic snafu, the Navy loses Baggs' records. He is offi­cially nonexistent. He can't be discharged from the hospital—or transferred, re­assigned, promoted, or paid. He seems condemned forever to his hospital niche though he's long since recovered. His superiors take pity on his limbo after a while and grant Baggs Cinderella liberty—off each evening and from noon on weekends, as long as he checks into his hospital bed by midnight. But it's a lonely existence for a penniless sailor until he meets bargirl Maggie Paul. Feckless, street­wise Maggie and her three children become John Baggs' life for a few hours each day. It is a crazy idyll that this impromptu family shapes for a few months—and, as idylls must, it ends. But not for keeps, and not in any way one might have imagined. For John Baggs, nonperson, becomes a person again—if not John Baggs. Instant, permanent fatherhood accompanies his new identity in an ending so raucous and touching that the reader finishes these pages in a surge of laughter and tears. Darryl Ponicsan's novel is a gusty de­light.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rTWsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Darryl Ponicsan "))
