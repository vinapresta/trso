He also plays poker when he has money. During a fight over a poker game, Matt is saved by Chip Donahue, the foreman of the Keenan ranch. Chip tels Matt that old man Jake Keenan died and he left his 87,000 acre ranch and fortune to Matt. Keenan had no family other than his illegitimate son, Matt. Whilst he was alive, old man Keenan never recognized Matt as his son and also treated Matt's mother very badly. Back at the ranch in Lobos, New Mexico, Matt rekindles his relationship with his former girlfriend, Janet Calvert. They decide to marry, despite her brothers' reluctance to accept Matt and in spite of Sam Mullen's advances toward Janet. Her brothers would rather see her marry Sam Mullen than Matt. When Janet's mother gives her blessings to Matt, things calm down and a celebration starts. Meanwhile, Chip Donahue the ranch foreman, discovers bank documents in the ranch's safe. These documents show that old man Jake Keenan was in debt to the bank and his lands and ranch were used as collateral. Because of the non-payment of debt, the bank can take over the ranch and lands within a few days. Chip Donahue brings the sad news to Matt and to Matt's tenants, raising their cattle on Matt's lands. The only solution seems to be the immediate repayment of debt to the bank. The only way Matt and his tenants can raise the money in such a short time is to sell three thousand herd of cattle to market in Santa Fe by the end of the week, but such a long cattle drive in such a short time is no easy task. To make matters worse, Sam Mullen and his friends are determined to sabotage Matt's plans.",slug:"cast-a-long-shadow"}}},books:{data:[{id:3992,attributes:{title:h,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"1974-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:3993,attributes:{title:"Valley of Guns\u002FCast a Long Shadow",description:"Two action-packed Westerns for one low price--a $7.98 value for only $4.99.

Dan Riley spends a month trying to find a bank to help them, but he fails. When the editor of The Clarion is shot, the ranchers blame Black Mike Sand, the manager of Skull, in spite of the circumstances of the shooting. As pressure mounts, Riley is determined to find out who is really in charge of the syndicate, and the only man willing to help him is Andrew Daniels, a former newspaper man whose courage comes from a bottle. Ex-gunman Rod Devers has started up a ranch, but small things going wrong on his land make him think someone might be trying to drive him out. In addition, the $2,000 he borrowed to buy his herd is coming due in a few months, and he refuses to marry his fiancée until he’s debt free. His brother George ramrods the Spade, the biggest ranch in the area owned by Karl Hermann, who is on his way to Spade. The two-bit ranchers are convinced Hermann is coming to grab up all the land, and they organize a group of vigilantes, the 99, to protect themselves. When Rod refuses to join the 99 and accepts his brother’s offer of a temporary job to protect Hermann and his daughter during their visit, the small ranchers turn against him.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=zSTCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2020-03-03",publisher:f,subtitle:i}},{id:3995,attributes:{title:"High Desert",description:"In the title story, Murdo Morgan left Paradise Valley sixteen years ago, after his brothers had been killed at the hand of the Turkey Track outfit. One year later, his father died a broken and defeated man. Broad Clancy, owner of the Turkey Track, has remained the controlling force in this area of high desert in Oregon, considering all the land to be open range, including the six-mile strip on both sides of the old wagon road which belongs to Cascade and Paradise Land Company. He fears that Morgan will return to exact his revenge for the death of his brothers. But Morgan is not driven by revenge but by a desire to carry out the dream of his father—to settle a thousand farming families in Paradise Valley. To that end, as the owner of the Cascade and Paradise Land Company, Morgan arrives with a plan for the sale of the land already under way and he is willing to risk his life and every cent of money he has to do it, despite the backlash he will receive from the Clancy dynasty. In “The Fence,” an Oregon sheriff must race against time to capture the men responsible for brutally murdering the father and grandfather of his former fiancée—before she becomes the next victim.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=4UZBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2018-01-02",publisher:f,subtitle:i}},{id:3996,attributes:{title:"Summer Warpath",description:"The summer warpath began in late spring 1876 and was one laid out under the command of General George Crook, perhaps the most experienced Indian fighter in the United States Army at that time. Among other officers under Crook’s command was the daring and resourceful Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and the 7th Cavalry. The purpose of the campaign was to round up the wild tribes of the Cheyennes and Sioux and place them on reservations. Walt Staley is a drifter, a man who works only long enough so he can get enough money to be traveling again. He rides for Fort Laramie, where he successfully enlists as an Army scout under General Crook. Before Staley arrives at the fort, he is forced by roving Indians to stop at an Army hay camp, where he meets Dave Allison. The two become friends, especially after Allison is transferred to active service under General Crook. Finally, there is Patrick O’Hara, who considers himself the ace reporter at the Chicago Herald. He wants most of all to be attached to Custer’s regiment, believing that Custer alone will be able to subdue the wild Indian tribes. He is disappointed when his editor instead sends him to be attached to General Crook’s expeditionary force.
