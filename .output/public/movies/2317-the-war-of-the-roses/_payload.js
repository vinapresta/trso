Just when it seems the Rose children are headed for self-destruction, hilarious and unpredictable events intervene in Adler's wicked follow-up.\" Pages Magazine \"In The War of the Roses, Adler set the ultimate standard for dysfunctional families. Now in his long-awaited sequel, the sins of the father are visited upon the next generation of Rose offspring... Adler's gift is to turn outrageously bleak scenarios into outrageously appealing black comedy.\" Booklist Warren Adler's The War of The Roses leaped onto the public consciousness and has since remained an essential thread in a wider tapestry of divorce iconography. Now, Adler presents us with the chandelier-shattering legacy of Barbara and Jonathan Rose relived in their children Josh and Evie in a hilarious sequel to the original iconic tale about the perils of marriage, divorce and the destructive power of materialism. Unlike the legendary Roses, Josh's marriage to Victoria should have all the qualities of an everlasting union. But when an innocent caper involving missing Milky Ways catapults out of control at their son's elite private school, the pair find themselves entering into a shattering warfare of a different kind. Armed with the emotional mayhem inherited from their parents, as well as compounded pressures involving a depraved headmaster, clandestine affairs and Victoria's male-hating mother, The War of the Roses - the Children presents a gripping story of the lengths to which parents will go to protect their children. Little more than a child herself, Josh's ever sympathetic and over-stuffed sister Evie lavishes her 'food-is-love' obsession on her beloved niece and nephew coping with their own sense of loss. Meanwhile, Michael and Emily, soon-to-be children of divorce, orchestrate their own plan to keep their family together at all costs. Adler, once again, demonstrates his storytelling mastery by revealing the intricate blending of the past with the present, and how time unravels all things seemingly perfect to be darkly and even comically dysfunctional.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=mPUmtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2013-03-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:11269,attributes:{title:"The Children of the Roses",description:"It happened again...",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hOWQU8JcuXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:a}},{id:11270,attributes:{title:"The War of the Roses - The Play",description:"The Classic Story of a Nasty Divorce. This play is based on the book that inspired one of the most famous movies about divorce ever produced.

It tells the story of Oliver and Barbara Rose who thought they had a perfect marriage, only to discover that their relationship was barely skin deep. The war they wage against each other eventually escalates into brutality and madness as they throw caution to the winds and destroy their most prized possessions as they spiral into chaos.
