But is love the only thing?' Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda is a swashbuckling adventure set in Ruritania, a mythical pocket kingdom. Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll closely resembles the King of Ruritania, and to foil a coup by his rival to the throne, he is persuaded to impersonate him for a day. However, Rassendyll's role becomes more complicated when the real king is kidnapped, and he falls for the lovely Princess Flavia. Although the story is set in the near past, Ruritania is a semi-feudal land in which a strong sword arm can carry the day, and Rassendyll and his allies fight to rescue the king. But if he succeeds, our hero and Flavia will have to choose between love and honour. As Nicholas Daly's introduction outlines, this thrilling tale inspired not only stage and screen adaptations, but also place names, and even a popular board game. A whole new subgenre of 'Ruritanian romances' followed, though no imitation managed to capture the charm, exuberance, and sheer storytelling power of Hope's classic tale.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tsXLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:true,published:"2020-02-20",publisher:"Oxford University Press, USA",subtitle:a}},{id:10664,attributes:{title:"The Prisoner of Zenda (Dodo Press)",description:"Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins, better known as Anthony Hope, (1863-1933) was a British novelist and playwright best remembered today for his short novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894), a prequel The Heart of Princess Osra (a collection of short stories) (1896), and a sequel Rupert of Hentzau (1898). These works were all set in the contemporaneous fictional kingdom of Ruritania. His first novel was A Man of Mark (1890), and one of his most well-known works during his lifetime was The Dolly Dialogues (1894), published in the Westminster Gazette. He started writing full time after Zenda's success, completing many other novels and plays, including English Nell (based on the life of actress Nell Gwyn), and Sophy of Kravonia (1906), in a similar vein as the Zenda story. He was knighted in recognition of his contribution to British propaganda efforts during World War I. He also published an autobiographical book, Memories and Notes, in 1927. His other works include: Father Stafford (1891), Half a Hero (1893), The Indiscretion of the Duchess (1894), Frivolous Cupid (1895), The King's Mirror (1899), and Quisante (1900).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Bl59PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:d,published:"2008-02-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10665,attributes:{title:e,description:"How is this book unique?

In a desperate attempt to deny Michael the excuse to claim the throne, Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim, attendants of the king, persuade his distant cousin Rudolf Rassendyll, an English visitor, to impersonate the King at the coronation.
