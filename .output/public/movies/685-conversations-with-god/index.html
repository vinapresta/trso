Many thousands of those readers have had questions for him--questions about religion, good and evil, physical and mental health, death, prophecy, the nature of God and the universe, prayer, angels and devils, spiritual paths, relationships, and much more. In Questions and Answers on Conversations with God, Neale, with characteristic wit and wisdom, responds to the most compelling and provocative of these letters; and the result is a book that is profoundly enlightening and inspiring. By relating the messages in the dialogues of CWG to the personal issues and everyday experience of individuals, Neale&#39;s answers illustrate the direct link between spiritual and physical reality, clearly demonstrating how what we do and who we are in our lives is a result of how we think and what we believe. This book gives us all the opportunity to look at ourselves, to change ourselves, and thus, perhaps, to change the world.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb4577"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJDVDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Conversations With God, Book 2" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Conversations With God, Book 2</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Neale Donald Walsch<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Hampton Roads Publishing</span><span><span> - </span>9/1/2020</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>How to deal with twenty-first century challenges, individually and globally. The Conversations with God books are among the most popular spirituality books published in the past 50 years. They have sold millions of copies in over two dozen languages around the world. For those who seek to explore the nature of God, the universe, and the meaning of existence, here are the questions that everyone wants to ask—and here are the answers that not only make sense, but also speak directly to the heart, with observations that ring true. In the introduction to Conversations with God, Book 1, Neale Donald Walsch was told that Book 2 “would deal with more global challenges now facing the world.” This is a book that looks at the big picture. What is here is a proposed paradigm shift to change the political and spiritual constructs that people have manifested on this planet. This is the challenge of the book: “Now is the time to reclaim yourself. Now is the time to see yourself again as Who You Really Are, and thus, render yourself visible again. For when you, and your true relationship with God, become visible, then We are indivisible. And nothing will ever divide Us again.”</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb4578"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Conversations with God Book 2 - Special Sales Edition</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Neale Donald Walsch<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->6/1/2008</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>AND GOD SAID...
