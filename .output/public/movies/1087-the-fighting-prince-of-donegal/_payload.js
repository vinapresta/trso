Red Hugh was a true champion for Irish liberty from Queen Elizabeth's constricting reign in the late 1580's and beyond. Hugh's capture, imprisonment, and escape from the Dublin Castle; his triumph over a blizzard and frostbite; his dramatic rescue of his family's castle; his conflict with the evil Captain Leeds; and his inexhaustible love for Ireland make this a wonderful read-aloud book for the entire family. You learn an astonishing amount of Irish geography and culture while relishing this true adventure, as well.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ZfeEAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Robert T Reilly","1997-08-01","Bethlehem Books","Prince of Donegal","Robert T.
