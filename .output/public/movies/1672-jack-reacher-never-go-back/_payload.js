Mais après bien des péripéties, Jack Reacher se réjouit de bientôt pouvoir rencontrer son nouveau commandant en chef, le major Susan Turner. Après avoir expédié au tapis deux individus qui lui conseillaient fortement de filer s'il ne voulait pas être traduit en cour martiale, Reacher pousse enfin la porte du bureau de Susan pour y découvrir à la place un certain commandant Morgan. Ce dernier, après avoir informé Reacher que le major Susan Turner n'était plus là, lui apprend qu'il est accusé d'avoir tué un certain Rodriguez seize ans plus tôt, qu'il n'y a pas prescription et qu'il est rappelé en service actif. Pendant ce temps-là, un homme se faisant appeler \" Romeo \" ne cesse de téléphoner à un certain dénommé \" Juliet \" pour savoir ce qui arrive ou va arriver à Reacher.
