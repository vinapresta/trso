Following Sailor’s death at the age of sixty-five in New Orleans, Lula moved back to her home state of North Carolina. This novel begins fifteen years later when Lula, at age eighty, decides to write a memoir in diary form, reflecting on her life with Sailor while also keeping a journal describing her last road trip: a journey with Beany Thorn, her best friend since childhood, back to New Orleans. Like a contemporary book of Revelations, dutifully recorded by Lula as a dialogue between self and soul, it becomes a bittersweet, often dangerous journey into the imagination of the heart, and what may lie beyond. Also included in this edition is \"The Truth is in the Work,\" a conversation between Barry Gifford and Noel King which delves into a range of topics, from Gifford’s early publishing experiences to his film projects and to professional sports.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9Vs8jFQYDTsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:d,publisher:e,subtitle:"Book Seven of the Story of Sailor and Lula"}},{id:11630,attributes:{title:h,description:"Despite her mother's disapproval, Lula Pace Fortune joins her boyfriend, Sailor Ripley, when he finishes serving his prison sentence for murder",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=AwfowAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"1990-01-01",publisher:m,subtitle:"The Story of Sailor and Lula"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309586208}}("Barry Gifford","movie",null,"2011-01-04","Seven Stories Press","series",1,"Wild at Heart","Sailor & Lula","On the twentieth anniversary of the publication of Barry Gifford's international bestseller, Wild at Heart, as well as the anniversary of the Palme d'Or–winning film adaptation by director David Lynch, Sailor & Lula: The Complete Novels presents all of the novels and novellas that comprise the saga of Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortune, \"the Romeo and Juliet of the South\": Wild at Heart, Perdita Durango (also made into a feature film), Sailor’s Holiday, Sultans of Africa, Consuelo’s Kiss, Bad Day for the Leopard Man, and The Imagination of the Heart.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=RG0-2ftUV2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","The Complete Novels",""))
