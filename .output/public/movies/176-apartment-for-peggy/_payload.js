Soon, Lynn also loves Tom, the young clerk down the hall. They are so in love that if they don’t get married, something improper is bound to happen. But her company has a strict new policy: Any woman who marries will be immediately fired. First published in 1931—the same year the Empire State Building opened its doors—Skyscraper marks the advent of a new kind of romance plot, and Lynn a new kind of heroine. Lynn is facing choices that will determine the course of the rest of her life, but rather than just choose between suitors, Lynn and other working girls like her must decide whether to abandon their careers—or abandon their men. They can’t have both—or can they? Femmes Fatales restores to print the best of women’s writing in the classic pulp genres of the mid-20th century. From mystery to hard-boiled noir to taboo lesbian romance, these rediscovered queens of pulp offer subversive perspectives on a turbulent era.
