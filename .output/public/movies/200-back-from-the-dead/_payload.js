Walking along the beach that night, Miranda hears strange voices, and when she returns home, becomes hysterical and falls into a coma. When she recovers, she is hostile and claims she is Felicia and not Miranda. Dick tells Katy that Felicia was his first wife, who died in a plunge from a cliff. Miranda asks to see Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, parents of Felicia, and when she calls Ada Bradley \"mother\", Dick and Katy realize she is possessed by \"the other one.\" Ada Bradley has been practicing black magic for six years and believes it is responsible for returning her dead daughter to her. Mr. Bradley, as one would expect, is horrified at both revelations, although the first one indicates he wasn't paying much attention to what his wife was doing when she was puttering around the kitchen the past few years. That night \"Felicia\" tries to kill Katy by flooding her room with gas, but Katy awakens in time. Both of the Bradleys suffer strokes - long odds, not impossible - that night and the old man dies while Ada is left paralyzed. The desperate \"Felicia\" seeks out Maitre Renall, also a black practitioner but on a grander scale than Ada Bradley, as the only person that can keep her alive. He promises to do so but only if she will make a blood sacrifice of an innocent victim. Nancy Corodell, jealous of Renall's attention to \"Felicia\", hears this and Renall's black magic gets tested by the hell-hath-no-fury method.",slug:"back-from-the-dead"}}},books:{data:[{id:511,attributes:{title:g,description:a,thumbnail:h,authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:i,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:512,attributes:{title:g,description:a,thumbnail:h,authors:[e],firstBook:d,published:i,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:513,attributes:{title:"Miranda, die Hexe (Possessed The other one, dt.)",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[e],firstBook:d,published:"1975-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:514,attributes:{title:"Cases and Materials on Torts",description:"Cases and Materials on Torts preserves historical and conceptual continuity between the present and the past, while addressing the most significant contemporary controversies in such fast-moving areas like public nuisance, global warming, and product liability, with new litigation against internet providers. Toward these dual ends, Richard A. Epstein and Catherine M. Sharkey have retained in the Twelfth Edition the great older cases, both English and American, that have proved themselves time and again in the classroom, and which continue to exert great influence on the modern law. Our book also provides a rich exploration of the dominant corrective justice and law-and-economics approaches to tort law, as exemplified both in the retained and new cases and materials. New to the Twelfth Edition: Extensive new treatment of public nuisance cases to address the profound expansion of the once-sleepy area of public nuisance law into the realms of the opioid crisis, toxic torts, and global warming. Major reconsideration of who counts as a seller in the chain of distribution for goods sold online with product liability updates for various forms of e-commerce, such as Amazon’s liability for defective products sold on its site. Updates to incorporate two major new Torts Restatements on Intentional Harms and Liability Insurance. The Reforms of the Michigan No-Fault Legislation Enhanced treatment of privacy in the era of “Big Data” to address trend of large data collectors like Facebook and Google to determine what is reasonable online, incorporating major privacy legislation such as California’s Consumer Privacy Act and the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Expansion of materials that address race and gender disparities in the setting of damages awards; and, in the realm of punitive damages innovative remedies directing some portion of the award to public interest groups. Professors and students will benefit from: Clear organizational framework of the book.
