Dr. Liang is a comfortably well-off professor of Confucian philosophy who fled China because of the government’s crackdown on intellectuals. Now, settled in 1940s New York, he believes in the notion of a pure and unchanging homeland. Under his influence, Liang’s four grown children make the momentous decision to move to China, despite having spent their whole lives in the United States. But as the siblings try in various ways to adjust to a new place and culture, they learn that the definition of home is far different from what they expected. Kinfolk is the involving story of an American family and literary fiction of the highest order. The New York Times–bestselling author of Dragon Seed, China Sky, and many other novels, explores the complexities of immigration, multiculturalism, nationality, and the primordial human longing to find our roots.
