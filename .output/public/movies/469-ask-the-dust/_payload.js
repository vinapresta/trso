Over the span of a half-century - from the early 1930s to the early 1980s - the Italian-American Fante (1909-1983) wrote short stories and novels that drew on his own life from his Catholic childhood in Colorado through his down-and-out days in Los Angeles, to his adventures as a screenwriter in Hollywood. He writes about all these things with gusto, humor, directness, and an honesty tinged with the irony of a true modernist.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bSXoUxx93F4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Long Beach) John Fante Conference (1995 California State University"],firstBook:e,published:"1999-01-01",publisher:"Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press",subtitle:"A Critical Gathering"}},{id:3676,attributes:{title:"John Fante's Ask the Dust",description:"This volume assembles for the first time a staggering multiplicity of reflections and readings of John Fante’s 1939 classic, Ask the Dust, a true testament to the work’s present and future impact. The contributors to this work—writers, critics, fans, scholars, screenwriters, directors, and others—analyze the provocative set of diaspora tensions informing Fante’s masterpiece that distinguish it from those accounts of earlier East Coast migrations and minglings. A must-read for aficionados of L.A. fiction and new migration literature, John Fante’s “Ask the Dust”: A Joining of Voices and Views is destined for landmark status as the first volume of Fante studies to reveal the novel’s evolving intertextualities and intersectionalities.
