This is Baggs' second enlistment. He's an unlikely sailor—onetime physics major, possible minister—but the Navy's a lot preferable to science or the pulpit, despite its absurdities, and he can still enjoy the pleasure of sins he wasn't willing to re­nounce. Then came the day he presented his ail­ment to the ship's doctor and was told he needed surgery and a thirty-day stay at the Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Vir­ginia. Not for John Baggs a conventional hospitalization, discharge, and return to duty. In the ultimate bureaucratic snafu, the Navy loses Baggs' records. He is offi­cially nonexistent. He can't be discharged from the hospital—or transferred, re­assigned, promoted, or paid. He seems condemned forever to his hospital niche though he's long since recovered. His superiors take pity on his limbo after a while and grant Baggs Cinderella liberty—off each evening and from noon on weekends, as long as he checks into his hospital bed by midnight. But it's a lonely existence for a penniless sailor until he meets bargirl Maggie Paul. Feckless, street­wise Maggie and her three children become John Baggs' life for a few hours each day. It is a crazy idyll that this impromptu family shapes for a few months—and, as idylls must, it ends. But not for keeps, and not in any way one might have imagined. For John Baggs, nonperson, becomes a person again—if not John Baggs. Instant, permanent fatherhood accompanies his new identity in an ending so raucous and touching that the reader finishes these pages in a surge of laughter and tears.

In this funny, bawdy, moving novel set during the height of the Vietnam War, two career sailors in transit in Norfolk, Virginia—Billy \"Bad-Ass\" Buddusky and Mule Mulhall—are assigned to escort eighteen-year-old Larry Meadows from Norfolk to the brig in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he is to serve an eight-year sentence for petty theft. It's good duty, until the two old salts realize the injustice of the sentence and are oddly affected by the naive innocence of their young prisoner. In the five days allotted for the detail, they decide to show Meadows something of the life he doesn't yet know, to help him survive the long ordeal ahead and to purge their own shame. What follows is an unlikely road trip by bus and train up the Eastern seaboard and an indelible journey of initiation and discovery, filled with beer-soaked wisdom, big city lights, revelry, brawls, debauchery, love, and surprising moments of tenderness.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_3agDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Darryl Ponicsán"],firstBook:b,published:d,publisher:"Skyhorse",subtitle:e}},{id:9258,attributes:{title:a,description:"Darryl Ponicsan never imagined that his first novel, \"The Last Detail,\" called by one critic \"...the first underground triumph of the 70s...\" would be a continuing story. With the invasion of Iraq, however, the same elements that inspired the original - injustice, a senseless war, men of honor and duty caught in untenable positions - compelled him to revisit Billy Bad-Ass, Mule, and the hapless Meadows, and to see how his characters were faring in post-9\u002F11 life. The result is \"Last Flag Flying,\" a story as tough and tender, sad and funny, as \"The Last Detail.\" The boy Billy and Mule escorted to prison has come back into their lives, now a grieving man of 52, with a gut-wrenching request they cannot deny.

Darryl Ponicsan's debut novel The Last Detail was named one of the best of the year and widely acclaimed, catapulting him to fame when it was first published. The story of two career sailors assigned to escort a young seaman from Norfolk to the naval prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire—and of the mayhem that ensues—was made into an award-winning movie starring Jack Nicholson. Last Flag Flying, set thirty-four years after the events of The Last Detail, brings together the same beloved characters—Billy Bad-Ass Buddusky, Mule Mulhall, and Meadows—to reprise the same journey but under very different circumstances. Now middle-aged, Meadows seeks out his former captors in their civilian lives to help him bury his son, a Marine killed in Iraq, in Arlington National Cemetery. When he learns that the authorities have told him a lie about the circumstances of his son's death, he decides, with the help of the two others, to transport him home to Portsmouth. And so begins the journey, centered around a solemn mission but, as in the first book, a protest against injustice and celebration of life too, at once irreverent, funny, profane, and deeply moving. Last Flag Flying is now a major movie from Amazon Studios, directed by Richard Linklater and starring Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, and Laurence Fishburne.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jjaCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Ponicsán, Darryl","Simon and Schuster"))
