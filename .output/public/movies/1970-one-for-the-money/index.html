Hereâs where it all beganâthe three novels that first brought us Stephanie Plum, that bounty hunter with attitude who stepped out of Trentonâs blue-collar âburgâ and into the heart of America. One for the Money: Stephanieâs all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad and doing her best to sever the worldâs longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelliâs the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. Thereâs still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase is interesting. Two for the Dough: Stephanie takes to the mean streets of Trenton, armed with attitude (not to mention stun guns and defense sprays), to find Kenny Mancuso, who recently shot his best friend and is on the run. Aided by the enigmatic Ranger, who knows a thing or two about bounty hunting, and by her irrepressible Grandma Mazur, Stephanie forms a shaky alliance with her favorite cop, Joe Morelli, for a tumultuous chase through back alleys and Grandma&#39;s favorite funeral parlors. Three to Get Deadly: Stephanie is having a bad hair dayâfor the whole month of January. Sheâs looking for Mo Bedemier, Trentonâs most beloved citizen, who was charged with carrying concealed and skipped bail. To help her, sheâs got Lula, a former hooker turned file clerk. Big, blonde, and black, Lulaâs itching to lock up a crook in the trunk of her car. And Morelli, the cop with the slow-burning smile, is acting polite even after Stephanie finds more bodies than the Trenton PD has seen in years. Thatâs a bad sign for sure. Funny and fabulous, Janet Evanovich is at her sparkling best in these three novels that launched a bestselling phenomenon.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9888"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>One for the Money</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Janet Evanovich<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by St. Martin&#39;s Paperbacks</span><span><span> - </span>4/14/2003</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>The dynamite blockbuster from Janet Evanovich that started it allânow a major motion picture starring Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum! ONE FINE MESS Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store). Stephanie needs cashâfastâbut times are tough, and soon she&#39;s forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family... ONE FALSE MOVE Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie&#39;s bail bonding company. She&#39;s got no experience. But that doesn&#39;t matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice cop Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father&#39;s Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot waterâwanted for murder... ONE FOR THE MONEY Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prizefighter Benito Ramirez isn&#39;t. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she&#39;ll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnightâand keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NzMxMDU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxNTA2Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster One for the Money" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie One for the Money is based on the book One for the Money? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">After losing her job, Jersey girl Stephanie Plum is broke. Needing a job she is told that her cousin, a bail bondsman, needs someone to help out in the office. But the only job openings he has are for skip tracers. She learns that Joe Morelli, a guy she knew intimately years ago, is one of the &quot;skips&quot;. She eventually finds him but wasn&#39;t really prepared so he gets away. Another bounty hunter, Ranger, tries to teach her. Eventually she finds Morelli again, but he claims he is innocent of the crime he is accused of and he is trying to prove his innocence. Eventually Stephanie thinks he&#39;s telling the truth so she stakes out the person who can help him. She only finds herself in trouble and Morelli saves her. She tries to find someone who can prove his innocence, but the problem is that shortly after meeting with them they&#39;re killed or attacked.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">5.3/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">2%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">22/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about One for the Money, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
