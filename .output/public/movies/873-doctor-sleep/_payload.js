Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence.

But when he unexpectedly meets twelve-year-old Abra Stone—who possesses an even more powerful manifestation of the shining—the two find their lives in sudden jeopardy at the hands of the ageless and murderous nomadic tribe known as the True Knot, reigniting Dan’s own demons and summoning him to battle for this young girl’s soul and survival...",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JIqrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"2019-09-24",publisher:"Gallery Books",subtitle:a}},{id:5338,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1GEJngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:f,published:"2014-05-22",publisher:"Pocket",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:5339,attributes:{title:"Doctor Sleep Film Tie-In Export Film Tie-in",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=4BWhxwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["STEPHEN.
