These collections of oddities engagingly work against the rationality and order of the conventional archive found in a university, a corporation, or a governmental holding. In form, methodology, and content, The Years Work in the Oddball Archive offers a counterargument to a more reasoned form of storing and recording the avant-garde (or the post-avant-garde), the perverse, the off, the bent, the absurd, the quirky, the weird, and the queer. To do so, it positions itself within the history of mirabilia launched by curiosity cabinets starting in the mid-fifteenth century and continuing to the present day. These archives (or are they counter-archives?) are located in unexpected placesthe doorways of Katrina homes, the cavity of a cow, the remnants of extinct animals, an Internet siteand they offer up \"alternate modes of knowing\" to the traditional archive.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TWYmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Joseph Campana","Theodore Bale"],firstBook:c,published:"2016-02-01",publisher:"Indiana University Press",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940957514}}("","Theodore Taylor",null,"The Stalker","A Novel"))
