Is Solomon Razor Bob Rimmer? Well, Bob is a bit older an octogeneian. But they both love all women, and like Solomon, Bob has sailed in Belize. Like Solomon, Bob has a wife who lets him write about and sleep with women like Anne Hutchinson, Elizabeth Pepys and in this story, a Vivien Leigh, look-alike all of whom died before their time. IS THIS A TRUE STORY? Bob believes that all of us have alter egos. We, not only, never stop living other people's lives celebrities or not but we live story book lives and as Peter Brook once said: \"Our lives are ceaselessly interwined with narrative. The stories we tell, or hear told, or imagine are reworked into our own lives. Many of us are \"wannabees.\" Sure, Bob wishes he had been Ian Fleming and made millions writing about James Bond. But Solomon Razor knows that his \"way to go\" story is true and more realistic and lovingly sexier, than any 007 missions, than Dirty Harry's or most good\u002Fbad guys including Clyde, Davy Crockett (King of the Wild Frontier) and Rhett Butler, whose names Solomon uses in his travels with various women on the Yucatan Peninsula. AS FOR YOU Will women readers wish they were Vivien Sweet, aka Scarlet O'Hara? or Myrtle Craddock aka Maggie Craddock or Phoebe Fortin aka Rarharu.
