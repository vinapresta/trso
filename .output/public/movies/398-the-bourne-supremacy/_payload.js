His memory is a blank. His bullet-ridden body was fished from the Mediterranean Sea. His face has been altered by plastic surgery. A frame of microfilm has been surgically implanted in his hip. His real name is a mystery. Marked for death, he is racing for survival through a bizarre world of murderous conspirators, led by Carlos, the world’s most dangerous terrorist. Who is Jason Bourne? The answer may kill him.

THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM “Vintage Ludlum.”—The Plain Dealer At a small-town carnival, two men, each mysteriously summoned by a telegram signed “Jason Bourne,” witness a bizarre killing. Only they know Bourne’s true identity. They understand that the telegrams are really a message from Bourne’s mortal enemy, Carlos.
