Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, directed by Joel Edgerton. \"Every sentence of the story will stir your soul\" (O Magazine). The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to “cure” him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=C55iCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"2016-05-10",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:3395,attributes:{title:"Boy Erased: A Memoir of Identity, Faith and Family",description:"NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING LUCAS HEDGES, RUSSELL CROWE AND NICOLE KIDMAN, AND WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY JOEL EDGERTON ‘A necessary, beautiful book’ Garth Greenwell, author of What Belongs to You ‘A brilliant memoir’ Guardian",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UmxCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:null,published:"2018-06-14",publisher:"HarperCollins UK",subtitle:""}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069457893}}("movie","series",1,"Boy Erased","Garrard Conley"))
