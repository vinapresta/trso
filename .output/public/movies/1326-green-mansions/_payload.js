It follows an intrepid adventurer who travels into darkest south-eastern Venezuela, where he comes into contact with a wild forest-dweller called Rima. A fantastic tale of love and tragedy, this book is not to be missed by lovers of vintage adventure literature. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Argentinian naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel \"Green Mansions\" (1904). Other notable works include \"A Crystal Age\" (1887) and \"Far Away and Long Ago\" (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QcqlDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2016-12-05",publisher:"Read Books Ltd",subtitle:d}},{id:7197,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=aY63tvtFpBAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:f,publisher:a,subtitle:d}},{id:7198,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=eVMRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:f,publisher:a,subtitle:d}},{id:7199,attributes:{title:b,description:"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.
