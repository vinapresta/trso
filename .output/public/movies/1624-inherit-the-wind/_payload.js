His trial was a Roman circus. The chief gladiators were two great legal giants of the century. Like two bull elephants locked in mortal combat, they bellowed and roared imprecations and abuse. The spectators sat uneasily in the sweltering heat with murder in their hearts, barely able to restrain themselves. At stake was the freedom of every American. One of the most moving and meaningful plays of our generation. Praise for Inherit the Wind \"A tidal wave of a drama.\"—New York World-Telegram And Sun “Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee were classic Broadway scribes who knew how to crank out serious plays for thinking Americans. . . . Inherit the Wind is a perpetually prescient courtroom battle over the legality of teaching evolution. . . . We’re still arguing this case–all the way to the White House.”—Chicago Tribune “Powerful . . . a crackling good courtroom play . . . [that] provides two of the juiciest roles in American theater.”—Copley News Service “[This] historical drama . . . deserves respect.”—The Columbus Dispatch","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=virWDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Robert E.

Lee","\"Collected here for the first time are the major plays of award-winning authors Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. This edition represents the only attempt to date to explore the range and nature of the team's collaboration. With introductions to each of the eight works - Inherit the Wind, Auntie Mame, The Gang's All Here, Only in America, A Call on Kuprin, Diamond Orchid, The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail, and First Monday in October - editor Alan Woods places the plays in their critical and historical contexts.\" \"Although they are known primarily as successful commercial writers, Lawrence and Lee have always shared a passionate commitment to larger social issues. Their plays were written not just to entertain a broad audience but to present some \"problem\" ideas - for example, the evolution versus creationism debate in Inherit the Wind, perhaps their most famous collaboration.\" \"While some of the plays collected here have become classics of the American stage, others remain obscure. In his introductions, Woods explores the factors that contributed to the success or failure of each play, including information about the actors and directors involved in the original production and the contemporary critical response.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
