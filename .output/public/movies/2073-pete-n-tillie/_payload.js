Without a Stitch in Time, a selection of forty-six articles and stories written for the New Yorker between 1943 and 1973, offers pun-filled autobiographical vignettes that reveal the source of De Vries’s nervous wit: the cognitive dissonance between his Calvinist upbringing in 1920s Chicago and the all-too-perfect postwar world. Noted as much for his verbal fluidity and wordplay as for his ability to see humor through pain, De Vries will delight both new readers and old in this uproarious modern masterpiece.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TjoiBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2014-11-17",publisher:"University of Chicago Press",subtitle:"A Selection of the Best Humorous Short Pieces"}},{id:10317,attributes:{title:"Madder Music",description:"Middle-aged, middle-class writer Bob Swirling copes with his puritanical upbringing, his repressed emotions and hostilities, his lack of self-confidence, and his imagined terminal illness by retreating into the identity of Groucho Marx",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=oqe6jYwdXLIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1982-01-01",publisher:"Viking Press",subtitle:b}},{id:10318,attributes:{title:"The Prick of Noon",description:"Eddie Teeters is simultaneously pursued by three would-be wives and a federal agent who wants Eddie convicted on obscenity charges for his part in a series of explicit sex-counseling videotapes",thumbnail:b,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1985-01-01",publisher:"Little Brown",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568411639}}("Peter De Vries","","movie",null,"series",1,"The Cat's Pajamas and Witch's Milk","Twin tales of middle-class hilarity and despair from the writer who was dubbed “America’s preeminent comic novelist” by the New York Times When college professor Hank Tattersall sees his former flame, Lucy Stiles, at a campus concert, it sets off a chain reaction that results in one of the funniest and most unforgettable exit scenes in American literature—involving a locked door, an alcoholic dog, and a punning doppelgänger. The Cat’s Pajamas is the story of how Tattersall, a scrupulous self-reflector, falls from point A to point Z, rushing through a host of identities and indignities along the way. The unexamined life may not be worth living, he discovers, but the examined one is hardly a bed of roses. In Witch’s Milk, Tillie Seltzer has her own trials to attend to. Chief among them is her marriage to Pete, the kind of guy who tucks a cigarette behind his ear and calls everybody Frisbee. When they first met, Tillie had more sophisticated tastes—dark strangers, homburg hats—but she was also a thirtysomething virgin whose prospects weren’t getting any better. When she cracked a joke about the honeymoon being over, Pete believed her. Now stuck in suburbia with a sick child and a philandering husband, Tillie takes a hard look in the rearview mirror. Her search for an escape route will lead her to the most unexpected place of all. These short novels are linked by Tillie’s cameo appearance in Hank’s narrative and by the thrilling blend of satire, tragedy, and philosophy that defines the one-of-a-kind fiction of Peter De Vries.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=h7NiBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2014-10-21","Open Road Media"))
