He empathizes with his son Ray when the boy is torn between pursuing a medical career or marrying Sylvia, banker Clem Bartholomew's daughter. Stephen's good deeds extend to the reformation of the town drunk, Mudcat, whose new gift wrapping gadget is patented by the kindly merchant. Disappointed in love years earlier when Clem married the woman he loved, Stephen nevertheless is called upon by the local residents to come to Clem's aid when his bank fails during the Depression. After Stephen rejects a plea by Sylvia to save the bank by making a large deposit, the locals learn of his apparently selfish refusal to act and form a lynch mob outside his house. Stephen addresses the crowd and disarms them by giving a speech on rights and ethics and by explaining that his reason for not helping is that he knows the bank will fail regardless of his aid because of poor management. At Christmas time, Stephen has a change of heart and decides to save Clem's bank on the condition that he be allowed to take control of its operations and rescue it from mismanagement. The reformed Mudcat is made vice president of the bank and Clem and Stephen make amends. Later, when Sylvia tells Ray that she plans to marry Rex, Stephen comforts his son by explaining how important it is to keep fond memories of lost loves, and at the same time, be able to appreciate present and future loves.",slug:"career"}}},books:{data:[{id:3902,attributes:{title:"State Fair",description:"Once a year, a tent city springs up overnight around the exhibition halls in Des Moines as farmers and their families pour in from across Iowa to attend the State Fair. After months of hard and often lonely work, farm families are given the chance to step out of their rural routines — picnic and gossip, sing and dance, take a chance at the hoopla stands, and strut their stuff in stiff competition for ribbons and prizes. When the close-knit Frake family set out from Brunswick, Iowa, Abel's hog, Blue Boy rode proudly in the back of the truck — manicured, curried and rubbed to enameled perfection — ready to compete and win the sweepstakes, the highest honor which any hog could attain. Melissa, Abel's wife, had her hopes set on beating the competition with the prize-winning quality of her pickles. Their teenage children, Wayne and Margy, found themselves faced with a pickle of another kind. Although committed to sweethearts in their hometown, brother and sister are each seized by a new love that sweeps them along, secretly and illicitly, somewhere between the sweet taste of cotton candy and the breathtaking plunge of a roller coaster ride. State fairs were a subject that Phil Stong knew well. For several years his grandfather had been superintendent of the swine division at the Iowa State Fair and, as a reporter for the Des Moines Register, Stong was assigned to cover the evening stock shows at the fair. Iowa held its first state fair in 1854, and for some time fairs were held at various locations around the state before permanently settling in Des Moines. State Fair is very much an Iowa book, filled with incidents and details from the author's own life. Although State Fair suggests a deep satisfaction and fondness for rural life, it shocked some readers in 1932 and was banned in the city library of Keosauqua, Iowa (Stong's hometown) for twenty-five years after it was published. However, judging from the success of the book and the enthusiasm shown for the movies that followed, most readers were captivated by the Frakes' down-home talk and whimsical humor and commended the author's portrayal of rural America.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2o86BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2015-01-15",publisher:c,subtitle:d}},{id:3903,attributes:{title:"High Water",description:"When a case of measles closes the grade school in Pittsville, Iowa during a raw and cold March winter, the excitement over a few days away from school is suddenly overshadowed by the flooding of the Des Moines River. During the summer, the river was a quiet drifting stream in which boys waded and dug for clams -- in winter, however, the river could turn into a torrent which loaded the bridge piers with the dead trunks of trees. As the people of the small town of Four Corners scramble for safety, three boys embark on an adventure of their own -- the rescue of a small brown and white burro named Mexico.

As a puppy he stood about two-feet-six in his bare feet and was about three cats long. Afterward he grew. Probably the most unusual, endearing dog ever to grace the pages of a book, No-Sitch is a one-of-a-kind dog in a one-of-a-kind story.

Grandpa Storr, full of years and wisdom, is a patriarch who has been the master of the Storr lands for generations. Witty and grand, he rules his homestead with a serene indifference to the petulant brood of relatives who fill the household. Grandpa Storr immediately detects in Louise the ancient Storr qualities of candor, independence and wit which have been so sadly lacking in the rest of the Storrhaven brood. While some members of the family and community look on with growing ill-will, Grandpa and Louise become very fond of one another. The young woman's marital difficulties are the subject of much gossip and when she takes to riding in the country with a married neighbor and accompanying him to dances, the family's ill-will turns to malevolence. The author has created an enormously life-like gallery of Iowans including a greedy and wasp-tongued niece by marriage, her lazy farm lawyer husband, a vague and foolish step-daughter, and a reliable farmhand fond of corn whiskey. Stong's sensitivity towards his characters and his obvious love of the farmland that sustains them, make Stranger's Return a classic well-worth rediscovery. Stranger's Return was also made into a popular movie by MGM starring Lionel Barrymore and Miriam Hopkins.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lpUWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:c,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069470557}}("movie","Phil Stong","eNet Press","","series",null,"2015-07-03",1))
