Phil Broker and Nina Pryce moved to Glacier Falls, Minnesota, seeking some peace and rest. No one in the wintry backlands knows about them or how, just a few months back, they were major players in averting a serious act of terrorismâ€”one that has left them both physically and psychologically shaken. But when a schoolyard bully provokes their daughter, Kit, and she gives him a bloody nose, the Broker family is set in the crosshairs of a vengeful local clan, notorious for violence and criminal behavior, that includes ex-con Gator Bodine, who knows a thing or two about Broker's past as an undercover cop. And when Gator learns of Broker's role in a drug sting that resulted in the death of a mobster's son, he lets the mob boss know just where to find Broker. As Broker finds himself caught between a band of backwoods meth cookers and a hit man bent on revenge, he has no choice but to take justice into his own hands to keep his family safe.","2013-11-26"))
