Caddie Woodlawn is a real adventurer. She'd rather hunt than sew and plow than bake, and tries to beat her brother's dares every chance she gets. Caddie is friends with Indians, who scare most of the neighbors—neighbors who, like her mother and sisters, don't understand her at all. Caddie is brave, and her story is special because it's based on the life and memories of Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother, the real Caddie Woodlawn. Her spirit and sense of fun have made this book a classic that readers have taken to their hearts for more than seventy years.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=mDiM4A1Kz3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2012-06-19",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:a}},{id:2178,attributes:{title:"Snow in the River",description:"This novel has interest...in the picture it gives of the western white pine forests and efforts to protect them against exploitation when the United States was young (1890s) and just beginning to realize that its wealth of natural resources was not inexhaustible....",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=0kQoAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1964-01-01",publisher:"Atheneum",subtitle:a}},{id:2179,attributes:{title:"Stopover",description:"An adult novel that recounts the pleasures and heartaches of aging actress Naomi Murdoch's return to the unforgiving Minnesota town and family she left years earlier.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xtI_yx5sXuAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1951-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:2180,attributes:{title:"Mademoiselle Misfortune",description:"Fourteen-year-old Alice Moreau, \"Mademoiselle Misfortune,\" enjoys a grand adventure touring France as traveling companion to the elderly American tourist, Miss Weatherwax, and brings some good fortune to her own family.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BrkqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1936-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703444915}}("","Carol Ryrie Brink","movie",null,"series",1))
