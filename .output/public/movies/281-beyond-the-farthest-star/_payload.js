When Nehemiah, the child of Jewish exiles, begins hearing whispers and experiencing portentous visions, it quickly becomes clear to his father and his rabbi that the young cupbearer is meant for a higher purpose . . . but what? Certain that the Messiah is alive at that very moment, the family waits for the boy’s destiny to be revealed. From the ancient site of the Garden of Eden, Nehemiah undertakes a perilous journey. The caravan route is full of danger, hardship, and mystery—all of it linked to what Nehemiah has in his keeping. In due time, his path becomes clear. It leads to Jerusalem, to a wealthy Pharisee named Joseph of Arimathea . . . and to Jesus of Nazareth. In Take This Cup, the second installment of the Jerusalem Chronicles, Bodie & Brock Thoene envision more of Scripture’s most enigmatic moments and expand their award-winning canon of historical fiction with unprecedented power and depth.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=R7-kCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:f,published:"2014-03-25",publisher:g,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531274244}}("movie","series","Beyond the Farthest Star","","Bodie and Brock Thoene",null,"Zondervan",1,"When a nativity display on public property is torched by a former US Senator, the media spotlight falls on the forgotten small town of Leonard, Texas, and the new pastor of its only church—Adam Wells. Emboldened by the prospect of leading his tiny congregation in a nationally-televised, first amendment debate that he considers to be a “fight for the heart and soul of America,” Pastor Wells determines not to let anything or anyone, including his wife and his rebellious sixteen-year old daughter, stand in his way. But when an old high school friend unexpectedly shows up in their small town and a past secret is revealed, Pastor Wells’ constitutional crusade collides with an even greater fight—the fight for the heart and soul of his marriage, his daughter, and, even his own life. In this modern-day story of betrayal, forgiveness, and finally redemption, Adam Wells discovers, for the first time, the meaning of the story he’s been preaching all his life...and his desperate daughter understands what really is beyond the farthest star. Award-winning authors, Bodie and Brock Thoene, have written an emotional and authentic drama based on a screenplay by Andrew Librizzi and now a major motion picture.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=mmgupQKP_y8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2012-01-03","A Novel"))
