Neil Schulman&#39;s acclaimed novel, Alongside Night, has been inspiring libertarians and Agorists, and a new motion picture adaptation is finished and getting set for theatrical release in the near future. Now the novel and movie is also a graphic novel. It&#39;s the near future and America is in trouble. Hyperinflation and disorder reign in the towns and cities of the nation. Alongside Night tells the story of Elliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. Martin Vreeland. When his family goes missing and while being shadowed by federal agents, Elliot, with the help of his mysterious companion Lorimer, explore the underground world of the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre to rescue them. It&#39;s a story of romance, intrigue, action, adventure, and exhilarating science fiction thrills. Beyond Elliot&#39;s personal journey, Alongside Night portrays -- in the words of Anthony Burgess -- &quot;an inflation- crippled America on the verge of revolution.&quot; When originally published in 1979 Alongside Night portrayed a futuristic dystopia ending with a fictional Agorist revolution; but decades later Alongside Night as novel, movie and a graphic novel now presents hope for a world ready to be renewed by the real-world Agorist movement pressing the re-set button on the universal freedom principles first fought for in the 18th century American Revolution. Alongside Night scored lavish praise for a first novel when it appeared in 1979, winning accolades from luminaries such as Anthony Burgess, the English novelist many consider the greatest of his generation, and Milton Friedman, the first American to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ten years later the Libertarian Futurist Society voted the book into the Prometheus Hall of Fame as a novel embodying the spirit of liberty, alongside Orwell&#39;s 1984, Rand&#39;s Atlas Shrugged, Heinlein&#39;s The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress, and Bradbury&#39;s Fahrenheit 451. The novel has been lauded on the pages of Publisher&#39;s Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, the Detroit News, Reason, and Liberty. In the years since its original publication Alongside Night has been praised as well by Dr. Ron Paul, Glenn Beck, and Austrian-school economics professors Dr. Thomas Rustici of George Mason University and Dr. Walter Block of Loyola University. The movie has been praised by Prometheus-award author, L. Neil Smith on the pages of The Libertarian Enterprise, who wrote, &quot;The story is, by turns, touching, suspense-filled, violent when violence was called for, highly polemic, and altogether satisfying.&quot; Art: Lee Oaks Characters, Story, and Dialogue: J. Neil Schulman Script Adaptation: Chris McCarver Lettering: James Gaubatz Praise for J. Neil Schulman&#39;s novel: &quot;I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light. That was until I read &quot;Alongside Night&quot; ... At last the missing puzzle piece!&quot; --The Dread Pirate Roberts, Founder Of Underground Site Silk Road And Radical Libertarian &quot;It is a remarkable and original story, and the picture it presents of an inflation- crippled America on the verge of revolution is all too acceptable. I wish, and so will many novelists, that I, or they, had thought of the idea first. A thrilling novel, crisply written, that fires the imagination as effectively as it stimulates the feelings.&quot; --Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange &quot;An absorbing novel--science fiction, yet also a cautionary tale with a disturbing resemblance to past history and future possibilities.&quot; -- Milton Friedman, Nobel laureate in Economics &quot;J.
