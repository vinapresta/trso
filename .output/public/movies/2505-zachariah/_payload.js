The book, Hesse's ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple, lyrical style. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became influential during the 1960s. Hesse dedicated the first part of it to Romain Rolland and the second to Wilhelm Gundert, his cousin.The word Siddhartha is made up of two words in the Sanskrit language, siddha (achieved) + artha (what was searched for), which together means \"he who has found meaning (of existence)\" or \"he who has attained his goals\". In fact, the Buddha's own name, before his renunciation, was Siddhartha Gautama, Prince of Kapilavastu. In this book, the Buddha is referred to as \"Gotama\".",thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2017-01-08",publisher:a,subtitle:"Hermann Karl Hesse Eng"}},{id:12059,attributes:{title:c,description:"A moral allegory, set in ancient India, about one soul's quest for the ultimate answer to the enigma of man's role in this world.
