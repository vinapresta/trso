Some imaginary friends never go away . . . Ten years after starting Project Mayhem, he lives a mundane life. A kid, a wife. Pills to keep his destiny at bay. But it won't last long, the wife has seen to that. He's back where he started, but this go-round he's got more at stake than his own life.The time has arrived . . . Rize or Die. New York Tomes bestselling novelist Chuck Palahniuk and acclaimed artist Cameron Stewart have collaborated for one of the most highly anticipated comic book and literary events of 2015--the return of Tyler Durden. The first rule of Fight Club 2 might be not to talk about it, but Fight Club 2 is generating international headlines and will introduce a new generation of readers to Project Mayhem. Praise for the comics that comprise Fight Club 2: \"At turns deeply poignant and very funny, Palahniuk's freakish fables capture a twisted zeitgeist and add an oddly inspirational and subversive voice to the contemporary canon.... In the post-9\u002F11 present, a hyperactive, Internet-obsessed, war- and recession-weary America apparently needs Tyler again.\"-THE ATLANTIC \"The book is fantastic, my highest recommendation.... Excellent work by Cameron Stewart and David Mack, and by our awesome friends at Dark Horse Comics.\"-Brian Michael Bendis \"If Tyler Durden needed a resurgence, there's no time like the present for his return... Fight Club 2 is a comic that taps back into everything great about the source material, and one that makes Tyler Durden's warm nihilistic embrace a welcome draw back into a familiar world of cynicism, violence, and anarchy....\"Tyler Lives,\" and I couldn't be happier by the prospect of more bedlam.\"-NEWSARAMA \"Palahniuk is delivering a worthy sequel to his most beloved story.\"-THE NERDIST \"Entertaining.\"-COMIC BOOK RESOURCES \"Excellent.\"-THE BEAT \"An amazing piece of work. You do not want to miss out on this.\"-COMICVINE \"Perfect.\"-FORCES OF GEEK \"We have a worthy sequel on our hands....
