However, while at a local sheep auction, she encounters Douglas and realizes she still loves him. They agree to meet that night at a country dance. But Sir Charles finds out about their intended rendezvous and at the dance that night, continually interrupts their reunion. He further hampers a reconciliation by allowing her to think that Douglas is the father of a maid's illegitimate child. Hilary, in reaction, goes wild and becomes the complete party girl, propositioning the band leader but going off with Jock, the real father of the maid's child. When Sir Charles finds Hilary asleep in his car the next morning, and she tells him of her antics of the night before, Sir Charles lapses into a deep depression as he realizes that his sister is lost to him.",slug:"brotherly-love"}}},books:{data:[{id:3543,attributes:{title:j,description:k,thumbnail:l,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:m,publisher:e,subtitle:f}},{id:3544,attributes:{title:j,description:k,thumbnail:l,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:m,publisher:e,subtitle:f}},{id:3545,attributes:{title:g,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1981-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:3546,attributes:{title:g,description:"Tunes of Glory Household Ghosts Silence This volume collects three of the very best works by James Kennaway, the brilliant young novelist and screenwriter who tragically died in a car crash at the early age of forty.
