Soon, his curiosity, mischievousness, and naivete lead him away from his father's shop and into a series of perilous encounters with vicious puppet masters, cunning animals, and other magical characters. Along this perilous journey, the magical puppet learns how much turmoil, heart, and hard work it takes to become a \"real boy.\" With a nose that grows larger with each lie he tells, Pinocchio has become an enduring icon in children's literature, and now his story is brilliantly reimagined in this stunning gift edition.

'The Adventures of Pinocchio' first appeared in 1881 as a series in a children's newspaper. Since then, readers young and old have delighted in Collodi's fantastic fairy-tale world, in which anything can happen and excitement waits round every corner. The exuberant young scamp Pinocchio ignores the advice of his kindly father and sets off into the world in search of adventure. Along the way he encounters many remarkable characters - including the nefarious Fox and Cat, a wise-talking cricket and a beautiful azure-haired fairy - and lurches from one predicament to another. Happily, by the end of the book, this wilful wooden hero finally learns his lesson and obtains his heart's desire - becoming a real boy. In this handsome new edition, award-winning illustrator Robert Ingpen has captured the rascally Pinocchio and his extraordinary escapades as never before, breathing new excitement into this enchanting classic.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rgJzzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2021-05-27",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703440579}}("","Carlo Collodi","movie",null,"The Adventures of Pinocchio","series",1))
