Danny knows at a glance that Red, the big Irish setter, is the dog he has always dreamed of. But Red is a champion, and Danny is only a trapper's son who lives in a cabin on the mountain. Still, their bond is undeniable. Red is fast and strong, smart and noble, and incredibly loyal--when Danny twists his ankle and can't get home, Red stays by him all night, keeping a wildcat at bay. Soon Danny and Red are meeting nature on their own terms, enduring a blizzard and even facing down a wolverine. But can Danny and Red take on the enemy that threatens everyone on the mountain--the savage bear they call Old Majesty? This special hardcover anniversary edition has a printed case featuring the original artwork from the 1945 first edition, and includes an interview with the author, Jim Kjelgaard. The original woodcut endpapers are reproduced in the back of the book. A biography of famed wildlife illustrator Bob Kuhn, whose black-and-white artwork brought Big Red to life, is also included, as well as an appreciation by National Book Award winner Pete Hautman.
