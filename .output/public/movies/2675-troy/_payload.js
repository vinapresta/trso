After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans.

This major work of ecological philosophy startles the senses out of habitual ways of perception. For a thousand generations, human beings viewed themselves as part of the wider community of nature, and they carried on active relationships not only with other people with other animals, plants, and natural objects (including mountains, rivers, winds, and weather patters) that we have only lately come to think of as \"inanimate.\" How, then, did humans come to sever their ancient reciprocity with the natural world? What will it take for us to recover a sustaining relation with the breathing earth? In The Spell of the Sensuous David Abram draws on sources as diverse as the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Balinese shamanism, Apache storytelling, and his own experience as an accomplished sleight-of-hand of magician to reveal the subtle dependence of human cognition on the natural environment. He explores the character of perception and excavates the sensual foundations of language, which--even at its most abstract--echoes the calls and cries of the earth. On every page of this lyrical work, Abram weaves his arguments with a passion, a precision, and an intellectual daring that recall such writers as Loren Eisleley, Annie Dillard, and Barry Lopez.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-aVDf4-42tAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Abram"],firstBook:true,published:"2012-10-17",publisher:"Vintage",subtitle:"Perception and Language in a More-Than-Human World"}},{id:12797,attributes:{title:"The Routledge Dictionary of Literary Terms",description:"Examines the significance and history of a wide range of terms and phrases related to the analysis of literature.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Q9Pc12Ty8zsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Peter Childs","Roger Fowler"],firstBook:b,published:"2006-01-01",publisher:"Taylor & Francis",subtitle:e}},{id:12798,attributes:{title:"Science in Action",description:"From weaker to stronger rhetoric : literature - Laboratories - From weak points to strongholds : machines - Insiders out - From short to longer networks : tribunals of reason - Centres of calculation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=sC4bk4DZXTQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Bruno Latour"],firstBook:b,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:"Harvard University Press",subtitle:"How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society"}},{id:12799,attributes:{title:"Theory of Literature",description:"Theory of Literature was born from the collaboration of René Wellek, a Vienna-born student of Prague School linguistics, and Austin Warren, an independently minded \"old New Critic.\" Unlike many other textbooks of its era, however, this classic kowtows to no dogma and toes no party line. Wellek and Warren looked at literature as both a social product--influenced by politics, economics, etc.--as well as a self-contained system of formal structures. Incorporating examples from Aristotle to Coleridge, written in clear, uncondescending prose, Theory of Literature is a work which, especially in its suspicion of simplistic explanations and its distrust of received wisdom, remains extremely relevant to the study of literature today.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CQ6xtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Rene Wellek","Austin Warren"],firstBook:b,published:"2018-09-10",publisher:"Scholarly",subtitle:e}},{id:12800,attributes:{title:"Landscapes of Realism",description:"Few literary phenomena are as elusive and yet as persistent as realism. While it responds to the perennial impulse to use literature to reflect on experience, it also designates a specific set of literary and artistic practices that emerged in response to Western modernity. Landscapes of Realism is a two-volume collaborative interdisciplinary exploration of this vast territory, bringing together leading-edge new criticism on the realist paradigms that were first articulated in nineteenth-century Europe but have since gone on globally to transform the literary landscape. Tracing the manifold ways in which these paradigms are developed, discussed and contested across time, space, cultures and media, this first volume tackles in its five core essays and twenty-five case studies such questions as why realism emerged when it did, why and how it developed such a transformative dynamic across languages, to what extent realist poetics remain central to art and popular culture after 1900, and how generally to reassess realism from a twenty-first-century comparative perspective.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OrglEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Dirk Göttsche","Rosa Mucignat","Robert Weninger"],firstBook:b,published:"2021-04-15",publisher:"John Benjamins Publishing Company",subtitle:"Rethinking literary realism in comparative perspectives.
