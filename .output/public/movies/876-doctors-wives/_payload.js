For, in the closed, inbred society of a great medical center, these women, the wives of superbly successful physicians, are driven by loneliness, boredom, and frustration along forbidden pathways. And alcohol, drugs, and promiscuity become their alternatives to despair. A radio bulletin tears the camouflage from the apparent prosperous tranquility of the community: \"A prominent Weston physician has just shot and killed his wife. A man, with the victim at the time and identified only as another doctor, was also seriously wounded.\" Five doctors' wives hear the announcement, and each one of them comes with despair and terror to realize that her husband, himself, just might be involved in the scandal—either as philanderer or killer. Where has trust gone? And where is love? Beneath this scandalous and passionate picture of human weakness, is a tale, perhaps even more striking: and that is Dr. Slaughter's brilliant, minute, expert's picture of the urgent business of an ultramodern hospital. His descriptions—in fascinating detail—of a heart operation and a brain operation, are breathtakingly suspenseful, and based on the most advanced medical and surgical knowledge.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=i25vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:i,publisher:d,subtitle:a}},{id:5350,attributes:{title:f,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Frank Gill Slaughter"],firstBook:e,published:i,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:5351,attributes:{title:"Doctor's Daughters",description:"Each time the \"Great God Malone\" stepped into the operating room, the world anticipated another miraculous breakthrough in heart surgery. Only two things remained to crown his enormous success: the arrival at the prestigious Malone Heart Institute of a test candidate for his revolutionary artificial heart, and the birth of a legitimate son to bear his name. Theo Malone won’t yield his power to anyone, espe­cially to his three beautiful daugh­ters, all successful doctors in their own right. But they've got enough drive to make it on their own. Lynn, actually a greater surgeon than her father, is torn between the man she loves and the father she hates, and her twin, Lisa, has proven herself the equal of her ego­tistical parent in both the fields of medicine and romance. Young Laurel, meanwhile, antagonizes Malone by helping to prevent the spread of an epidemic, inadver­tently uncovering a scandal that could ruin his reputation forever. A skillful probe into the highly dramatic inner workings of large city hospitals, DOCTOR'S DAUGH­TERS once again shows Frank G.

What happens when this deadly organism, for which there is no antidote, reap­pears, forms the basis of this sensational novel by the author of Code Five. This is the story of one man in par­ticular—Dr. Grant Reed and the dedi­cated crew of the international hospital ship Mercy, as they set about the task of quarantining the first victims of a hideous plague. Set adrift by frightened Peruvians, the aging and crippled ship faces a hurricane, mutinous patients, and even a pair of great white sharks, grisly mascots of a ship of death. . . . Frank Slaughter here takes on one of the most important and exciting subjects to be found among his novels—the complex, high-stakes world of interglobal medicine, taking us behind the public deeds to the private people whose courage can make the difference between today's flus . . . and tomor­row's headlines.
