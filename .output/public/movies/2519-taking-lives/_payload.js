He didn't just take the boy's life; he went on to live it. When that life became too risky, he found another, and another, changing his name, papers and style at will, until he chose the wrong life -- a scholarly thief on the run from the determined and troubled John Costa. The two men will meet, and there will be murder. But there is something much worse: the sweet seduction of taking another's life to be your own. Chillingly suspenseful, brilliantly executed and truly disturbing, Taking Lives is an entertainment to make you think and shiver.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=R_klskgV0scC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","The Pieces from Berlin","In the great disorder of wartime Berlin, Lucia Muller-Rossi was an unofficial star: mistress to an Ambassador, the whole world to her young son, and guardian of all the lovely things her Jewish friends were forced to leave behind as they took the trains tothe death camps.

In that moment, a whole lifetime of silence cracks open and Lucia's family face the wrenching duty of examining a past almost too horrifying to remember.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=AqldK_ZnJwgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
