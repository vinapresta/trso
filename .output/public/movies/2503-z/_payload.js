The organization's charismatic leader - the deputy - is scheduled to arrive in the town from the capital the day of the rally. Beyond the problems arranging the rally due to the probable incitement of violence at such a rally, the organization learns of an unconfirmed report that there will be an attempt on the deputy's life. The rally does happen, after which a three-wheeled kamikaze runs over the deputy, who eventually passes away from his injuries. The official report is that the incident was a drunken accident. In reality, the deputy's death was murder orchestrated by the secret police, the general for who likens the pacifist organization to mildew killing off agricultural crops. A magistrate is assigned to the case. Although he does have political views, he is more interested in finding out the truth, and as such has to wade through the political rhetoric and politically motivated testimony he hears. Thrown into the mix is a photojournalist who too is looking for the truth, as it, he believes, will make a great front page story.",slug:"z"}}},books:{data:[{id:12045,attributes:{title:e,description:f,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pGFOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:12046,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1969-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12047,attributes:{title:"Z.",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1968-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12048,attributes:{title:e,description:f,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-rtQCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:12049,attributes:{title:"The Few Things I Know about Glafkos Thrassakis",description:"Available for the first time in English, a masterpiece by one of Greece's most renowned modern writers explores the line between the real and the fictional with grace and profound insight.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=N_9vQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["VasilÄ“s Vasilikos","Karen Emmerich"],firstBook:c,published:"2002-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940916385}}("","Vassilis Vassilikos",null,"Z","Z, 50th Anniversary Edition","A progressive parliamentary deputy is scheduled to appear at a political rally. Meanwhile, local political bosses plot his assassination. Thugs are recruited to disrupt the rally. Rumors begin to spread. But the forces already set in motion are irresistible. Z is the story of a crime, a time, a place, and people transformed by events. Z was published in Greece in 1966, and banned there one year later. It is based on an actual political assassination in 1963 in Salonika. The victim was Gregory Lambrakis, a socialist legislator and outspoken critic of the government. But Lambrakis's killers could not have anticipated the public response. His funeral became a political event; by the time the cortege reached Athens, 400,000 people were following the coffin in silence. In the nation's capital, the letter Z suddenly appeared on walls, sidewalks, posters--everywhere. Z stands for the Greek verb zei, \"he lives.\"","2017-02-28","Seven Stories Press"))
