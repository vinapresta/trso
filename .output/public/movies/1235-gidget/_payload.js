It has received Academy Award nominations, although it does not appear to have won any. In a video about the movie, it is admitted that Sandra Dee, the star, did not actually go swimming in the water. Gidget is a fictional character created by author Frederick Kohner (based on his teenage daughter, Kathy) in this 1957 novel, Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas. The novel follows the adventures of a teenage girl and her surfing friends on the beach in Malibu. The name Gidget is a mixture of \"girl\" and \"midget\". Following the novel's publication, the character appeared in several films, television series and television movies.

Unquote Glicksberg! I don't know what kind of things he writes but I found my inspiration in Malibu with a radio, my best girlfriends, and absolutely zillions of boys for miles. I absolutely had to write everything down because I heard that when you get older you forget things, and I’d be the most miserable woman in the world if I forgot all about Moondoggie and what happened this summer. I absolutely owe the world my story. (And every word is true. I swear.)” This is Franzie, part Holden Caulfield, part Lolita. The guys call her Gidget—short for girl midget. Based on the experiences of his own daughter, Frederick Kohner’s trend-setting novel became an international sensation with an irrepressible heroine whose voice still echoes every thrill, every fear, and every hope that every teenager ever had about growing up.
