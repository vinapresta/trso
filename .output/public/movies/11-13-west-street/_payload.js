Walter Sherris--\"successful, happy, good husband and father--\"made just one mistake: he took a walk along a dark road one night. Without warning, a car raced towards him and screeched to a stop; out piled five young men intent on violence. To the accompaniment of wild brainless laughter, Walter Sherris was beaten to the ground. He awoke in a hospital nine days later. And from that moment his pleasant life became a nightmare, more horrible than those he had wrestled with in those nine days of unconsciousness. Walter Sherris wanted revenge: for the broken leg and the pain; for the doubts he now had about his pretty young wife; and for the countless and nameless others who had been mauled by the thrill seekers, the sadists, the compulsive slayers . . . the tigers loose in a tame suburban world. The police were evasive, almost disinterested. There were no witnesses. So Walter Sherris set out alone to trap the tiger. The Tiger Among Us was filmed as 13 West Street (starring Alan Ladd).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BODrJkvFY2YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2001-01-01",publisher:"Wildside Press LLC",subtitle:a}},{id:1765,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1957-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:1766,attributes:{title:"A World Is Born",description:"The first ripples of blue fire touched Dio's men.

Then he grinned and said mockingly.\"Hell of a place to spend the rest of your life, ain't it?\"Mel Gray stared with slitted blue eyes down the valley. The huge sun of Mercury seared his naked body.
