Margaret's mother is Christian and her father is Jewish. Margaret has been raised without an affiliation to either faith, and does not practice an organized religion, although she frequently prays to God in her own words, beginning by saying, \"Are you there God? It's me, Margaret.\" She is beginning to feel uncomfortable with her lack of a religious affiliation. For a school assignment, she chooses to study people's religious beliefs, hoping to resolve the question of her own religion in the process. Part of her study involves attending different places of worship to better understand religious practice and also to see if one of them might be right for her. She enjoys spending time with her Jewish paternal grandmother, Sylvia Simon, who loves her as she is, and hopes Margaret will embrace Judaism after taking her to her synagogue for Rosh Hashanah services.",slug:"are-you-there-god-its-me-margaret"}}},books:{data:[{id:13125,attributes:{title:e,description:"Faced with the difficulties of growing up and choosing a religion, a twelve-year-old girl talks over her problems with her own private God.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Agl_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:"2014-04-29",publisher:f,subtitle:b}},{id:13126,attributes:{title:e,description:"Celebrate the legacy of the bestselling and iconic Are You There God?
