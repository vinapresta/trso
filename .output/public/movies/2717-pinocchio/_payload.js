Determined to have great adventures, Pinocchio runs away. Out in the big world, he makes many animal friends—and enemies—including a cat, a fox, a fire-eater, a giant dog-fish, and sea monsters. He is thrown in jail, stranded on an island of bees, in danger of being fried like a fish, and turned into a donkey. And every time he tells a lie, his nose grows longer. But he wants more than anything to be a real boy. The classic tale of the rebellious marionette who discovers what it means to be human continues to delight young readers across the world.

From the moment Joseph the carpenter carves a puppet that can walk and talk, this wildly inventive fantasy takes Pinocchio through countless adventures, in the course of which his nose grows whenever he tells a lie, he is turned into a donkey, and is swallowed by a dogfish, before he gains real happiness. This new translation does full justice to the vibrancy and wit of Collodi's original. Far more sophisticated, funny, and hard-hitting than the many abridged versions (and the sentimentalized film) of the story would suggest, Ann Lawson Lucas's translation captures the complexity of Collodi's word-play, slapstick humour, and immediacy of dialogue. An adult reader will recognize social and political satire, and the invaluable introduction and notes illuminate the cultural traditions on which Collodi drew.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=3RQxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:b,published:"2021-06-15",publisher:"Phoemixx Classics Ebooks",subtitle:c}},{id:12948,attributes:{title:e,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[a],firstBook:b,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:j}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940902151}}("Carlo Collodi",null,"","Pinocchio","Le Avventure Di Pinocchio","Carved from a piece of pine by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a small Italian village, Pinocchio was created as a wooden puppet, but dreamt of becoming a real boy.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=N5qDDtCeh1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2005-08-31","Univ of California Press","Storia Di Un Burattino"))
