It was historical fiction but many of the life stories about my grandfather, James Alburn Knight, later picking up the name Jack, and his family were true happenings. Bullwhip Justice has many of the same characters but is total fiction. My publisher for the first book said I had failed to put romance in the book and needed to write about a love interest for my main character. So we now have Bullwhip Justice and a love affair that carries our main character on highs and lows of several magnitudes. It fulfills the meaning behind the title. Jack continues his skillful use of the bullwhip and finds the use helpful in reducing the death rate in the growing west saving the final justice as the perfect place to display the diversity of the bullwhip.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=e4rRUUfhMU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["George Richard Knight"],firstBook:b,published:"2011-12-02",publisher:"Author House",subtitle:a}},{id:11546,attributes:{title:"Condensed Reports of Cases in the Supreme Court of the United States",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ygBLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Richard Peters"],firstBook:b,published:"1845-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Containing the Whole Series of the Decisions of the Court from Its Organization to the Commencement of the Peter's Reports at January Term 1827, with Copious Notes of Parallel Cases in the Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts of the United States"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940924763}}("",null,"The White Buffalo","Richard Sale"))
