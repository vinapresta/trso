As Nancy A. Walker notes in her introduction to the present volume, anyone familiar with Maddux's previously published work will recognize these stories as the products of Maddux's imagination and experience.\" \"Maddux believed that her fiction depicted \"the way things are\" at a given place and time: the barter system used by small businesses during the Depression, the discomfort of a little girl meeting her first celebrity, the human drama that goes on in an unremarkable small town in Oklahoma. Her fiction often captures the particular flavor of everyday life during definable periods in twentieth-century America. \"The House in the Woods,\" \"Guaranteed,\" and \"Change\" evoke the World War II period from the perspective of the wives of servicemen, while \"No Smoking, No Spitting,\" \"The Little Woman,\" and \"They're Laughing\" afford glimpses of the lives of Depression-era workers. Yet these stories are not merely period pieces, nor are they in any sense nostalgic. Instead, they capture the precise moment in an effort to locate the fragile, yet crucial, quality of true human connectedness.\" \"Maddux defined the inspiration for her writing as \"the re-capturing of one's own childhood,\" a period when \"there is a continual teeter-totter of the real and the imaginary, the subconscious and the conscious mind.\" The strange, almost surreal element of many of these stories come from their origin in the intersection between the child-like imagination, in which anything is possible, and the skill of the mature writer who gives the imagination shape.\" \"Other books by Maddux to be published the University of Tennessee Press are A Walk in the Spring Rain, together with The Orchard Children; The Green Kingdom; and Abel's Daughter. Already published is her autobiography, Communication, with her novella, Turnip's Blood.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Both were written after Maddux and her husband, King Baker, moved to Houston County, Tennessee, in 1960, and both draw upon her experiences with and perceptions of life there in the 1960s and 1970s. A Walk in the Spring Rain is a novel, and The Orchard Children is nonfiction, but both books deal with discovery, love, and loss - themes that transcend a specific place.\" \"A Walk in the Spring Rain, first published in 1966 by Doubleday, was reissued in paperback by Avon in 1978. A film version of the novel, starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, premiered in 1970, and the novel was included in the book Fiction into Film, published by the University of Tennessee Press later that year. What makes this short novel so compelling? It is a love story - the most popular theme in human narrative - affirming the power and possibility of human love, at any age and in any circumstances. Set in West Virginia, it owes much of its specific sense of locale to Maddux's own adjustment to rural life in Houston County.\" \"The Orchard Children, first published in 1977, is the account of Maddux and Baker's unsuccessful attempt to adopt two foster children. In emphasizing the importance of childhood, it has affinities with Maddux's only other autobiographical work, Communication, written in 1941 when she was twenty-eight and published in 1991 by the University of Tennessee Press. Just as one of the central themes of Communication is the need to take children seriously on their own terms - to pay attention to their requirements for honesty and affection - so the message of The Orchard Children is that the legal system, which determines who will raise abused or abandoned children, seems often to ignore the best interests of the children themselves. Maddux's universalizing of her story resulted, as with A Walk in the Spring Rain, in a wider audience for The Orchard Children. The book inspired a CBS television documentary, titled \"Who Will Save the Children?\" and starring Shirley Jones and Len Cariou, which aired in December of 1978.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
