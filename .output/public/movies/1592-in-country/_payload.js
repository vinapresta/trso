She's one of our very best writers.” —Ann Beattie, author of A Wonderful Stroke of Luck The author of such classics as Shiloh and the memoir Clear Springs, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, Kentucky-born Bobbie Ann Mason has been hailed as “a full-fledged master of the short story” by Anne Tyler and “an American original” by Jayne Anne Phillips. This reader collects outstanding examples of Mason’s award-winning work from throughout her career and provides a unique look at the development of one of the country’s finest writers. Patchwork contains short stories first published in the New Yorker and other leading periodicals; chapters from Mason’s acclaimed novels, including In Country, An Atomic Romance, and The Girl in the Blue Beret; and riveting excerpts from Mason’s eclectic nonfiction. Some examples of Mason’s recent explorations in flash fiction appear here in print for the first time. Mason’s writing glows with a nuanced understanding of the struggles and pathos of American life in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As George Saunders says in his introduction, “Bobbie Ann Mason is a strange and beautiful writer. . . . Her stories exist to gently touch on, and praise, even mourn, what it feels like to be alive in this moment.” Patchwork conveys Mason’s extraordinary talent and range.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DGc1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2018-06-29",publisher:"University Press of Kentucky",subtitle:"A Bobbie Ann Mason Reader"}},{id:1117,attributes:{title:"The Girl in the Blue Beret",description:"Inspired by the wartime experiences of her father-in-law, Bobbie Ann Mason has crafted the haunting and profoundly moving story of an American World War II pilot shot down in Occupied Europe, and his wrenching odyssey of discovery, decades later, as he uncovers the truth about those who helped him escape in 1944. At twenty-three, Marshall Stone was a confident, cocksure U.S. flyboy stationed in England, with several bombing raids in a B-17 under his belt. But when enemy fighters forced his plane to crash-land in a Belgian field during a mission to Germany, Marshall had to rely solely on the kindness of ordinary Belgian and French citizens to help him hide from and evade the Nazis. Decades later, restless and at the end of his career as an airline pilot, Marshall returns to the crash site and finds himself drawn back in time, unable to stop thinking about the people who risked their lives to save Allied pilots like him. Most of all, he is obsessed by the girl in the blue beret, a courageous young woman who protected and guided him in occupied Paris. Framed in spellbinding, luminous prose, Marshall’s search for her gradually unfolds, becoming a voyage of discovery that reveals truths about himself and the people he knew during the war. Deeply beautiful and impossible to put down, The Girl in the Blue Beret is an unforgettable story—intimate, affecting, exquisite—of memories, second chances, and one intrepid girl who risked it all for a stranger.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WuHN99mxzm4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2011-06-28",publisher:"Random House",subtitle:g}},{id:1118,attributes:{title:"Shiloh and Other Stories",description:"\"These stories will last,\" said Raymond Carver of Shiloh and Other Stories when it was first published, and almost two decades later this stunning fiction debut and winner of the PEN\u002FHemingway Award has become a modern American classic.
