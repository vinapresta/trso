Robbie Whitcomb is five years old when heâs taken from his mother in a mall parking lot. In her attempt to chase the kidnapper, sheâs left badly injured and permanently disfigured. Such are the methods of the man who calls himself Daddy Loveâa man known to the rest of the world as charismatic preacher Chester Cash. For the next six years, Robbie is to be Daddyâs son. That means doing whatever Daddy saysâand giving him whatever he wants. Soon Robbie learns to accept his new name, Gideon. He also learns that he is not the first of Daddy Loveâs sons. And that each of the others, after reaching a certain age, was never seen again. As Robbieâs mother recovers from her wounds, her life and marriage are a daily struggle. But as years go by, she maintains a flicker of hope that her son is still alive. Meanwhile, Robbie approaches the âbittersweet ageâ with no illusions about his fate. But somewhere within this tortured child lies a spark of rebellion. And he knows all too well what survival requires. âAfter all these years, Joyce Carol Oates can still give me the creeps.â âMarilyn Stasio, The New York Times Book Review âA lean and disturbing tale that reverberates after its ending.â âThe Columbus Dispatch âOates makes us squirm as she forces us to see some of the action through Loveâs twisted and warped perspective.â âKirkus Reviews âThis unsettling tale showcases Oatesâs masterful storytelling.â âPublishers Weekly</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11083"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kWoZBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Jack of Spades" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Jack of Spades</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Joyce Carol Oates<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Open Road + Grove/Atlantic</span><span><span> - </span>5/5/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>An exquisite, psychologically complex thriller about opposing forces within the mind of one ambitious writer and the delicate line between genius and madness. Andrew J. Rush has achieved the kind of critical and commercial success most authors only dream about: He has a top agent and publisher in New York, and his twenty-eight mystery novels have sold millions of copies. Only Stephen King, one of the few mystery writers whose fame exceeds his own, is capable of inspiring a twinge of envy in Rush. But Rush is hiding a dark secret. Under the pseudonym âJack of Spades,â he pens another string of novelsânoir thrillers that are violent, lurid, and masochistic. These are novels that the upstanding Rush wouldnât be caught reading, let alone writing. When his daughter comes across a Jack of Spades novel he has carelessly left out, she picks it up and begins to ask questions. Meanwhile, Rush receives a court summons in the mail explaining that a local woman has accused him of plagiarizing her own self-published fiction. Before long, Rushâs reputation, career, and family life all come under threatâand in his mind he begins to hear the taunting voice of the Jack of Spades. âSleek and suspenseful . . . Readers are sure to be gripped and unsettled by [Oatesâs] depiction of a seemingly mild-mannered character whose psychopathology simmers frighteningly close to the surface.â âPublishers Weekly, starred review âJust when you think youâve got her all figured out, Joyce Carol Oates sneaks up behind and confounds you yet again. She does it with a wicked flourish in Jack of Spades.â âThe New York Times Book Review</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11084"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=RAheCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Doll-Master" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Doll-Master</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Joyce Carol Oates<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Grove/Atlantic, Inc.</span><span><span> - </span>5/3/2016</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>This Bram Stoker Awardâwinning collection is âcertain to stick in your mind long after youâve turned the last pageâ (St. Louis Post-Dispatch). Includes âBig Momma,â a finalist for the International Thriller Writers Award for Best Short Story Here are six of Joyce Carol Oatesâs most âfrighteningâand deeply disturbingâshort storiesâ (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette). In the titular story, a boy becomes obsessed with his cousinâs doll after her tragic death. As he grows older, he begins to collect âfound dollsâ from surrounding neighborhoods . . . each with its own sinister significance. In âGun Accident,â a teenage girl is delighted to house-sit for her favorite teacher, until an intruder forces his way insideâchanging more than one life forever. The collection closes with the taut tale of a mystery bookstore owner whose designs on a rare bookshop in scenic New Hampshire devolve into a menacing game with real-life consequences. âAt the heart of each story is a predator-prey relationship, and what makes them so terrifying is that most of us can easily picture ourselves as the prey, at least at some time during our livesâ (Minneapolis Star-Tribune). âEverything she writes, in whatever genre, has an air of dread, because she deals in vulnerabilities and inevitabilities, in the desperate needs that drive people . . . to their fates. A sense of helplessness is the essence of horror, and Oates conveys that feeling as well as any writer around.â âTerrence Rafferty, The New York Times Book Review âOne of the stranger parts of the human condition may be our deep fascination, and at times troubling exploration, of the darker aspects of our nature . . . No other author explores the ugly, and at times, blazingly unapologetic underbelly of these impulses quite like Joyce Carol Oates in The Doll-Master.â âPittsburgh Post-Gazette âIn her new collection . . . [Oates] relishes moments of gothic melodrama, while rooting them firmly in grindingly ordinary American lives.â âThe Guardian âOates convincingly demonstrates her mastery of the macabre with this superlative story collection . . .

Sixteen-year-old Katya Spivak is out for a walk on the gracious streets of Bayhead Harbor with her two summer babysitting charges when sheâs approached by silver-haired, elegant Marcus Kidder. At first his interest in her seems harmless, even pleasant; like his name, a sort of gentle joke. His beautiful home, the childrenâs books heâs written, his classical music, the marvelous art in his study, his lavish presents to herâMr. Kidderâs life couldnât be more different from Katyaâs drab working-class existence back home in South Jersey, or more enticing. But by degrees, almost imperceptibly, something changes, and posing for Mr. Kidderâs new painting isnât the lighthearted endeavor it once was. What he wants from Katya is something she canât comprehend. What Katya wants from him is something else again. As their relationship deepens, and twists, the question is whoâs seducing whom? And to what end? From a National Book Award winner and #1 New York Times bestselling author, A Fair Maiden is âfresh, current and gripping . . . the insight shrewd and the violence vivid . . .
