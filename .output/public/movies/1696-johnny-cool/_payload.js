With alert empathy, he follows Jack Carter as he hunts down his brother's killers in Ted Lewis's masterpiece Jack's Return Home (\"a kind of dark English Gatsby\") ; suffers along with violence-averse Rae Ingram coping alone on a small yacht with a dangerous paranoid in Dead Calm (\"a philosophical thriller\") by that fine Gold Medal novelist Charles Williams; and gives a lot of attention to Donald Hamilton's young professional men entangled with enigmatic young women in pre-Helm works like The Steel Mirror (1948) where he was learning his craft. In a fourth chapter, he hacks at the wall between \"art\" and \"entertainment\" and loose talk about the \"world\" of the thriller. Lastly, he reminiscences about a fascinating safari that he made into the sex-'n-violence \"Mushroom Jungle\" (British pulp fiction ca.1946-54), and offers conclusions about violence and peace. He avoids jargon, combines an aficionado's enthusiasm with a scholar's accuracy, quotes generously to convey the texture of a work, provides background information for readers new to the topic, and illuminates \"craft\" aspects of fiction in general. His emphasis throughout is positive.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wEK1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["John Fraser"],firstBook:i,published:"2015-04-29",publisher:"eBookIt.com",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377308778}}("","movie","series",1,"The Kingdom of Johnny Cool","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ooRNAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","John McPartland","1959-01-01",null))
