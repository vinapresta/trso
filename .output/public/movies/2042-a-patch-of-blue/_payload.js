In title novella 'With Kisses on Both Cheeks' Kata encapsulates this time of flux within the Kay household. Julie Kay, the only child of conservative suburban parents, looks with longing at the free loving atmosphere of the migrant family next door. Desperate for friendship, she sneaks into this forbidden world and begins a double life, that of light and warmth with the Bitinas, and that of smothering control at home. When Julie finally moves out, her rebellion leads her to a way of life so far from her upbringing that it may be too progressive even for her. The short stories that make up the rest of the collection are an eclectic mix of themes, from the moving 'Friendship', where two families, one Jewish and one German, have their bond tested by the Second World War, to the bizarre and humorous 'The Gazing Ball' in which we see a lonely New York store assistant's obsession with a crystal ball. With Kisses on Both Cheeks, first published in 1981, demonstrates Kata's remarkable ability to entertain with thoughtful and current themes, no matter what the subject matter.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=d4l0CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2015-10-13",publisher:f,subtitle:a}},{id:10164,attributes:{title:"The Death of Ruth",description:"Molly Blake is a woman with a gruesome secret from which she cannot escape.

Enduring suffering at the hands of the sadistic Captain Tanaka who is tormented by desire for the woman he hates, Mary's miserable existence is suddenly disrupted when she helps to conceal a wounded American airman in her cottage. Mary, Suzuki, and the easy-going black market trader Ludi Hoffer, must now elude the investigations of police officer Noguchi in order to protect the airman and themselves. But will Noguchi's beguiling daughter unravel their secret? And how will their fortunes change in the aftermath of the atomic bomb and the destruction of Hiroshima? In Someone Will Conquer Them, first published in 1962, Kata draws on her own experience of life in wartime Japan, and brings to life a dynamic cast of characters, each unique yet united by a common humanity in spite of cultural differences and the hardships of war. The defeat and subsequent occupation of Japan serves as a backdrop to Mary Ogata's own journey to understanding friendship, love, and, ultimately, herself.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=XvGuCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2015-11-19",publisher:f,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069485056}}("","movie","Elizabeth Kata","series",null,"Bloomsbury Publishing",1,"1961-01-01"))
