When larger-than-life cattle rancher Jordan \"Bick\" Benedict arrives at the family home of sharp-witted but genteel Virginia socialite Leslie Lynnton to purchase a racehorse, the two are instantly drawn to each other. But for Leslie, falling in love with a Texan was a lot simpler than falling in love with Texas. Upon their arrival at Bick's ranch, Leslie is confronted not only with the oppressive heat and vastness of Texas but also by the disturbing inequity between runaway riches and the poverty and racism suffered by the Mexican workers on the ranch. Leslie and Bick's loving union endures against all odds, but a reckoning is coming and a price will have to be paid. A sensational and enthralling saga, Ferber masterfully captures the essence of Texas with all its wealth and excess, cruelty and prejudice, pride and violence.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Rf0qm_gD1MoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2013-07-30",publisher:e,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:6816,attributes:{title:c,description:"This sweeping tale captures the essence of Texas on a staggering scale as it chronicles the life and times of cattleman Jordan \"Bick\" Benedict, his naive young society wife, Leslie, and three generations of land-rich sons.

It has the completeness, [the] finality, that grips and exalts and convinces.\" — Literary Review Widely regarded as the master work of celebrated author and Algonquin Round Table mainstay Edna Ferber—who also penned other classics including Show Boat, Giant, Ice Palace, Saratoga Trunk, and Cimarron—So Big is a rollicking panorama of Chicago at the turn of the 20th Century. Following the travails of gambler's daughter Selina Peake DeJong as she struggles to maintain her dignity, her family, and her sanity in the face of monumental challenges, this is the stunning and unforgettable \"novel to read and to remember\" by an author who \"critics of the 1920s and 1930s did not hesitate to call... the greatest American woman novelist of her day\" (New York Times). So Big is a must-read for fans of contemporary novelists such Willa Cather (O Pioneers!), Pearl S. Buck (The Good Earth), and Marjorie Rawlings (The Yearling).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nh9ZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2022-01-29",publisher:"Phoemixx Classics Ebooks",subtitle:a}},{id:6818,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1963-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"From the Novel by Edna Ferber"}},{id:6819,attributes:{title:"Giant ",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vqkZsVtjEKYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1952-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940976883}}("","Edna Ferber","Giant",null,"Harper Collins"))
