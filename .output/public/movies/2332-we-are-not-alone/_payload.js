Given that most publicity releases of the time (and also now) are best when taken with several grains of salt, this may or may not be true: Dr. David Newcome lives with his wife Jessica and son Gerald in the small English town of Calderbury. Jessica, conventional and somewhat stupid, is unable to understand the sensitive little boy and her stern, unsympathetic discipline aggravates Gerald's nervousness. The doctor is called to care for Leni, an Austrian dancer stranded in England, who has tried to commit suicide, and he decides she is just the person to hire as a governess for Gerald based on, evidently, no logic at all, but it does move the plot. Jessica learns the true story of Leni's background and demands she be discharged. Dr. Newcome arranges to have Leni enrolled in a music school. Gerald, being sent away to stay with his uncle, goes back into the house to retrieve a toy his mother has confiscated and, in getting it, he knocks over and breaks a bottle of pills. He stuffs these pills into a bottle containing his mother's headache pills. Jessica returns home, takes her headache pills, and the maid later finds her dead. Meanwhile, Leni and the Doctor are saying farewell when they hear the news of the outbreak of the War. Realizing that Leni, because of her nationality, will be in danger if she stays in England,he offers to take her on his bicycle to a nearby town where she can take a train for the start of the return to her homeland. But they are arrested for Jessica's murder and have the appearance of flight working against them. Gerald, the only person who can prove their innocence, has been told nothing of what has happened at the request of his father. With both sentenced to be hanged, the film's title comes from the line when the Doctor tells Leni, \"We are not alone in suffering injustice.\"",slug:"we-are-not-alone"}}},books:{data:[{id:11335,attributes:{title:g,description:"The life of a skillful English doctor is shattered because of a German girl he befriends.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ebhHAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1937-01-01",publisher:"London : Macmillan",subtitle:a}},{id:11336,attributes:{title:g,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1941-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:11337,attributes:{title:"The Collected Novels Volume One",description:"Three classic novels by James Hilton, about a world—and men—forever changed in the time between two world wars In So Well Remembered, George Boswell, a respected lawyer and civic leader, possesses the skill and charisma to shine on the national stage. But ambition is not without a cost. When he must choose between the promise of a bright future and staying behind for the people who have come to depend on him, his decision comes at a shocking price in this story of a people pulled reluctantly toward modernity amid the farms and factories of Lancashire. In Random Harvest, a veteran’s comfortable life is upended when long-buried memories of his time in the trenches of World War I come rushing back. This moving account of the trauma of war explores the courage required to find redemption in the face of the most overwhelming circumstances. And in We Are Not Alone, brilliant but naïve country doctor David Newcome courts tragedy when he invites a stranger into his home—and his family is torn asunder as their country and the world outside are drawn into war.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=PHuozQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2013-05-21",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:"So Well Remembered, Random Harvest, and We Are Not Alone"}},{id:11338,attributes:{title:"Lost Horizon",description:"Four people are transported to the dream-like world of Shangri-La where life is eternal and civilization refined.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Zrff6zEyXEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1960-01-01",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:a}},{id:11339,attributes:{title:"Goodbye, Mr. Chips",description:"The classic novel of school life, the captivating tale of a school teacher of genius.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bGfkbyCgtTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1982-12-01",publisher:"Laurel Leaf",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568382184}}("","James Hilton","movie",null,"series",1,"We are Not Alone"))
