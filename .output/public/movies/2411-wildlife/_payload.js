His father, Jerry, loses his job. And though he was offered his job back, he refuses to take it back because he \"won't work for those kind of people anymore\". So instead, he takes a job fighting a forest fire, which his wife, Jeanette, is dead set against, both for safety reasons, and because she's convinced that he will be unfaithful while away. But he leaves anyway. And yet, without anything happening to him, or any evidence of hanky-panky on his part, she acts the way one would expect her to act had he perished in the fire, or if she had found out that he had been unfaithful while away. This fact causes Joe to acquire uneasy feelings toward his mother. His father does return however. But the three are no happier for it, as Jeanette has taken up with a new significant other in her life. And Jerry reacts furiously against this. The parents wind up separating as she moves to take up a teaching job in Oregon, while Joe continues to live with his father. And then, she suddenly announces that she's taking the bus to visit over the weekend. Perhaps in an odd way, this movie combines both a satisfactory and unsatisfactory ending.",slug:"wildlife"}}},books:{data:[{id:11660,attributes:{title:f,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:b}},{id:11661,attributes:{title:f,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:b}},{id:11662,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:b}},{id:11663,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:b}},{id:11664,attributes:{title:"Using Digital Terrain Modeling to Predict Ecological Types in the Balsam Mountains of Western North Carolina",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FZq4v0cVOI8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Richard H.

When Joe Brinson was sixteen, his father moved the family to Great Falls, Montana. But the new start didn’t go quite as planned. Jerry Brinson is a golf pro to rich country club members, but then loses the job. In reaction, he joins a firefighting crew working in the mountains—as his wife becomes entangled in an affair with one of the businessmen from the club. Told from the point of view of Joe as a grown man looking back on those days in 1960, Wildlife is a “heartbreaking and compelling” novel about love, family, and the forces that test them to the breaking point by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Canada and The Sportswriter (Philadelphia Inquirer). The basis for a film starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan, Wildlife is “a wise, humane, and disarmingly simple novel of domestic distress” (Entertainment Weekly). “There is at the heart of this novel a deep nostalgia for that moment when a person recognizes a true perfection in the way things once were, before the onset of ruin and great change.”—The New York Times Book Review","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ImCZV-tK_pUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2010-01-19","Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc.","Conversations with Richard Ford","Interviews with the Pulitzer Prize--winning author of The Sportswriter and Independence Day","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=AVp34bb_wwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2001-01-01","Univ.
