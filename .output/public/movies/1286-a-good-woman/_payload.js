The texts are newly edited, with modernized spelling and punctuation where appropriate; and there are scholarly introductions and annotation. Oscar Wilde was already one of the best-known literary figures in Britain when he was persuaded to turn his extraordinary talents to the theatre. Between 1891 and 1895 he produced a sequence of distinctive plays which spearheaded the dramatic renaissance of the 1890s, and retain their power today. The social comedies, Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, and An Ideal Husband, offer a moving as well as witty dissection of society and its morals, with a sharp focus on sexual politics. By contrast, the experimental, symbolist Salome, written originally in French, was banned for public performance by the English censor. Wilde's final dramatic triumph was his 'trivial' comedy for serious people, The Importance of Being Earnest, arguably the greatest farcical comedy in English.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YrkRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"Oxford University Press",subtitle:"Salome ; A Woman of No Importance ; An Ideal Husband ; The Importance of Being Earnest"}},{id:7065,attributes:{title:"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays",description:"Offers newly edited texts of five of the British playwright's works, including the great farcial comedy \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=a53An7aoEAYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2008-04-17",publisher:"Oxford Paperbacks",subtitle:"Lady Windermere's Fan; Salome; A Woman of No Importance; An Ideal Husband; The Importance of Being Earnest"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069569908}}("movie","Oscar Wilde","","series","Lady Windermere's Fan",null,1))
