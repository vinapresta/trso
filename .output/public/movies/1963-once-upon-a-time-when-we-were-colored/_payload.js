With no home or family, the Perry sisters are orphaned and alone. On the final afternoon of owning her farm, Esther greets a strange guest. The haughty woman and her grand carriage are out of place in a farm town like Bayview, Maine. She introduces herself as Lucia Curtis and informs them she is their aunt.
