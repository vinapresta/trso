In this colorful and comprehensive history of the cattle industry in the American West, Paul I. Wellman reaches back to the early sixteenth century, when the first cattle were brought from Spain to Mexico. He hits his stride in describing the great cattle drives that began after the Civil War when Texans desperately needed to ex-pand their markets. Hell-bent cow towns like Abilene and Dodge City make a big noise again, and so do figures of different bents: Joseph C. McCoy, Charles Goodnight, Oliver Loving, John Chisum, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Wild Bill Hickok, and Billy the Kid. The coming of barbed wire and the great blizzards of 1886 and 1887 brought about dramatic changes in the cattle industry—all chronicled down to 1939, when The Trampling Herd was first published.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=uICOZkfaoZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[h],firstBook:c,published:"1988-01-01",publisher:"U of Nebraska Press",subtitle:"The Story of the Cattle Range in America"}},{id:4452,attributes:{title:d,description:"Texas Ranger Tom Gatling arrests gambler Paul Regret, but soon finds himself teamed with his prisoner in an undercover effort to defeat a band of renegade arms merchants and thieves known as Comancheros.
