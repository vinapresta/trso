Everyone knows Lew and knew his grandfather, old \"Gramp\" Marsh (Harry Carey), who had passed on. One evening, Lew and his wife, Agnes (Frances Dee), reminisce lovingly about their son, \"Rusty\" (Richard Crane), when a telegram arrives from the Navy Department informing them that \"Rusty\" had been killed in action. Lew becomes bitter, avoids people, refuses to go near the family drugstore. \"Gramp\" appears before Lew and takes him in hand and together, they revisit the past: Lew's childhood; \"Gramp\" as a Civil War veteran; Lew's courtship of Agnes; the birth of \"Rusty\"; Lew as a WWI soldier; Rusty's boyhood days and into his attempt to decide between Lenore Prentiss and Gretchen Barry, and how Lenore becomes his girl just before he joins the Navy. This excursion into the past takes away Lew's bitterness and he now sees what America means.",slug:"happy-land"}}},books:{data:[{id:7373,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=cDNNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:b,publisher:"Speaking Volumes",subtitle:a}},{id:7374,attributes:{title:"Happy Land by MacKinlay Kantor, and Tacey Cromwell by Conrad Richter",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[d],firstBook:c,published:b,publisher:a,subtitle:"Two Novels in One Book"}},{id:7375,attributes:{title:"Happy Land ",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UiXMlHUnUccC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["MacKinlay Kantor "],firstBook:c,published:b,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:7376,attributes:{title:"HAPPY LAND AND TACEY CROMWELL",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ekg5M-aW9PUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["MACKINLAY KANTOR AND CONRAD RICHTER"],firstBook:c,published:b,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:7377,attributes:{title:"Happy Land, by MacKinlay Kantor",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[d],firstBook:c,published:b,publisher:a,subtitle:"And Tacey Cromwell, by Conrad Richter ; Two Great Novels of America -- Today and Yesterday ; Two Novels in One Book"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940982409}}("","1943-01-01",null,"MacKinlay Kantor","Happy Land"))
