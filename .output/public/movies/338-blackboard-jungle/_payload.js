Despite Principle Warnecke's assertions to the contrary, Dadier quickly learns that the rumors of student discipline problems at the school are indeed true. The established teachers at the school try to counsel the newcomers, all inexperienced in such situations, as how best to handle the rowdy students. Regardless, Dadier tries to exert discipline in his class, which provokes a violent response. Dadier believes the student leaders against him are Artie West, but more specifically Gregory Miller, who he thinks uses the fact of being black as a means of racial provocation. Dadier has to decide either to leave and teach at a \"real\" school, or stay and figure out how to get through to his students. If he decides to stay, he has to figure out who the real disruptive influences are, especially as they have resorted to attacks of a personal nature that affect especially Anne.",slug:"blackboard-jungle"}}},books:{data:[{id:3146,attributes:{title:f,description:"The \"shocking\" and \"suspense-packed\" bestseller about one teacher's stand against student violence, and the basis for the Academy Award-nominated film (The New York Times Book Review).

His writing includes screenplays, literary novels, and children's books, but he is perhaps best known for his hugely successful 87th Precinct series, penned under the pseudonym Ed McBain. The book that launched Hunter into a full-time writing career and onto the bestseller lists was his first major novel, The Blackboard Jungle. Written in 1954, this controversial story cracked down on the public school system and dramatized student violence as no other novel of its time did. Hunter used his own teaching experience to create protagonist Richard Dadier, who lands his first real job as an English teacher at North Manual Trades High School in New York City. Dadier knows the students here will be tough, but nothing has prepared him for the world he enters. Hunter's popular and groundbreaking novel attracted much attention when it was first published, and it became a top bestseller in 1955. Set against the changing social culture of the 1950s, The Blackboard Jungle is a fascinating time capsule that brilliantly illuminates an issue still in the forefront of our minds.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=C59WBt6l48AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1985-01-01",publisher:"Macmillan Reference USA",subtitle:b}},{id:3148,attributes:{title:f,description:"The “shocking” and “suspense-packed” bestseller about one teacher’s stand against student violence, and the basis for the Academy Award–nominated film (The New York Times Book Review).

Ed McBain is known for portraying the soul of the cop. They have distinct narrative voices, but both are bestselling storytellers who have received worldwide acclaim. Now, in Candyland, they join for the first time to write a single story -- a powerful novel of obsession. Benjamin Thorpe is married, a father, a successful Los Angeles architect -- and a man obsessed. Alone in New York City on business, he spends the empty hours of the night in a compulsive search for female companionship. His dizzying descent leads to an early morning confrontation in a midtown bordello and a searing self-revelation. Part I of Candyland is a fever-pitched search for identity, seen through Benjamin's obsessed eyes and told in classic Evan Hunter style. Part II opens in Ed McBain territory. Three detectives are discussing a homicide. The victim is a young prostitute whose path crossed Benjamin Thorpe's the night before. Emma Boyle of the Special Victims Unit is assigned to the case. As the foggy events of the previous night come into sharper focus, Thorpe becomes an ever more possible suspect. The detailed police investigation and excruciating suspense are classic Ed McBain. Shocking, bold, and compulsively readable, Candyland is a groundbreaking literary event.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WxRk7aKBWMAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[k,d],firstBook:e,published:"2001-01-03",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:"A Novel in Two Parts"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531278941}}("movie","","series","Evan Hunter",null,"The Blackboard Jungle",1,"2017-06-13","Open Road Media","A Novel","Ed McBain"))
