What unfolds over the next few years is truly epic, constantly illuminating and surprising, sometimes comic, always entrancing, and ultimately all-too-human in its tragic grandeur. Christophe, as educated as any Frenchman could be about the “sauvages” of the New World whose souls he has sworn to save, begins his true enlightenment shortly after he sets out when his native guides—terrified by even a scent of the Iroquois—abandon him to save themselves. But a Huron warrior and elder named Bird soon takes him prisoner, along with a young Iroquois girl, Snow Falls, whose family he has just killed. The Huron-Iroquois rivalry, now growing vicious, courses through this novel, and these three are its principal characters. Christophe and Snow Falls are held captive in Bird’s massive village. Champlain’s Iron People have only lately begun trading with the Huron, who mistrust them as well as this Jesuit Crow who has now trespassed onto their land; and Snow Falls’s people, of course, have become the Hurons’ greatest enemy. Bird knows that to get rid of them both would resolve the issue, but he sees Christophe, however puzzling, as a potential envoy to those in New France, and Snow Falls as a replacement for the two daughters he’d lost to the Iroquois. These relationships wax and wane as life comes at them relentlessly: a lacrosse match with an allied tribe, a dangerous mission to trade furs with the French for the deadly shining wood that could save the Huron nation, shocking victories in combat and devastating defeats, then a sickness the likes of which none of them has ever seen. The world of The Orenda blossoms to include such unforgettable characters as Bird’s oldest friend, Fox; his lover, Gosling, who some believe possesses magical powers; two more Jesuit Crows who arrive to help form a mission; and boys from both tribes whose hearts veer wildly from one side to the other, for one reason or another. Watching over all of them are the spirits that guide their every move. The Orenda traces a story of blood and hope, suspicion and trust, hatred and love, that comes to a head when Jesuit and Huron join together against the stupendous wrath of the Iroquois, when everything that any of them has ever known or believed in faces nothing less than annihilation. A saga nearly four hundred years old, it is also timeless and eternal.

The model that will be presented regards the effects of the expected punishment as the main condition that drives the criminal behavior unto an optimal choice. Indeed, the criminal conduct must be induced primarily by two factors: The impunity feeling and the opportunities. This work aims to analyze whether the same relationship preached by the Broken Window Theory could be verified in a wider scenario with the interaction not only between minor serious crimes but also among several kind of different crimes and offenses. The determination of violent crimes, those related to the citizens' life, is viewed in this thesis as a function of the property crime, those related to the public and private property, and the policing enforcement. A mathematical model is also proposed as a framework that is able to explain this reality. Using a monthly crimes dataset provided by the Department of Public Safety of 10 jurisdiction around the world, it is developed a multiple regression analysis for the years of 2011-2014 in the city of São Paulo and it is estimated Spearman rank correlation and price elasticities for the crimes of nine from the 20 most violent cities of the world in order to validate the theatrical mathematical model proposed. I argue that the highest homicide rates in nine of 2013 ten most violent cities of the world are strongly correlated to the high levels of impunity in suppressing crimes against property in the short term. The conclusion states, as in the Broken Windows Theory, that once the offenses are committed in the majority by the same people, when the feeling of impunity arose due a low policing enforcement over the property crimes, these property crimes begins to decrease, giving rise",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OmRSzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Thyago Celso C.

Dilip Menon's book traces the social history of comunism in Malabar, the bastion of the movement, and looks at how the ideology was transformed into a doctrine of caste equality, as national strategies were reshaped by local circumstance and tinged by pragmatism. While existing literature concentrates on the intricacies of party policy, Dilip Menon explores the diversity of political practice within a particular region. He particularly analyses the relationship between landowners and cultivators, demonstrating their economic and cultural interdependence. Inequality and difference were tempered by a perception of shared symbols and values. As the author points out, the success of communism in Kerala lies in its recognition of this fact.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rnuBIgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Dilip M.
