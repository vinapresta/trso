Still, because he is a 'good boy', he plays on the soundless piano, and takes weekly lessons from a piano teacher so eccentric that she will only allow him to strum out the notes on her dining room table... until, like real planets when other bodies get too close, he finds himself pulled and moved in a different direction.",slug:"the-planet-of-junior-brown"}}},books:{data:[{id:10409,attributes:{title:"Planet of Junior Brown, The",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Viginia Hamilton"],firstBook:true,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940941689}}(""))
