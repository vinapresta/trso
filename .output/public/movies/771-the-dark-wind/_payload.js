Jim Chee in trouble with the FBI—which drew ex-Lieutenent Joe Leaphorn out of retirement into an old crime he longed to forget. Legends of the area’s lost gold mines join the mountains and canyons of the Navajo Reservation as elements of Hillerman’s plot, but this tale turns on an obsessive love and memories of a missing woman’s voice wailing in the darkness.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Wy_t_HEZzP0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2009-10-13"))
