Fictitious and semi-abstract, this project is built on real and imaginary action - a young girl applying herself to the toughest layers of history she read or heard about. She is reminiscent of Alice in tragic Wonderland or of Shakespearean Ophelia with her longing for simplicity. Blurry monologue of the video is not meant to be spelled out, but rather states a very private nature of her \"confession\" without guilt. The focus of it is a young girl placing herself in different historical and geographical environments, traveling in her mind through different mise-en-scenes. She seems to meditate in the face of nature about life and death, faith and disbelief. She dives into the imaginary world of her own, in the world of memories inherited from stories told by her grandparents. Confession as a subject of study is necessary for humans to understand themselves. If confession does not serve to discover truth, it will, at the least, teach her fundamental rules of life. For the artist, there is a possibility of studying a pure event, no longer manipulated or interpreted by the historical subjectivity. Any superficial interpretation of habitual confession would drain the girl's visions. She turns to the beauty of the past, rediscovers that \"history survives its disappearance\" (Jean Baudrillard).",slug:"confession"}}},books:{data:[{id:4511,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}},{id:4512,attributes:{title:"Fertig",description:"Sol Yurick’s cult novel, originally published in 1966, blasts the American judicial system and society in general.
