They could not be more wrong. Haunted by remorse and jarred by rumors of his late wife's infidelities, Quayle surprises everyone by embarking on a personal odyssey that will take him across three continents. Using his privileged access to diplomatic secrets, he will risk his own life, stopping at nothing to uncover and expose the truth - a conspiracy more far-reaching and deadly than Quayle could ever have imagined.",slug:"the-constant-gardener"}}},books:{data:[{id:4551,attributes:{title:a,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[g],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:d}},{id:4552,attributes:{title:a,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:[j],firstBook:c,published:"2020-09-03",publisher:"Penguin Classics",subtitle:b}},{id:4553,attributes:{title:a,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[g],firstBook:c,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:d}},{id:4554,attributes:{title:"Conversations with John Le Carré",description:"Master spy thriller writer John le Carré talks about his craft, the nature of language, the literature he loves, and the ways his life influences the creation of his novels and his characters in this collection of engaging interviews with George Plimpton, Melvyn Bragg, and other luminaries.

But in the wake of his estranged father’s death, Magnus vanishes, and the British Secret Service is up in arms. Is it grief, or is the reason for his disappearance more sinister? And who is the mysterious man with the sad moustache who also seems to be looking for Magnus? In A Perfect Spy, John le Carré has crafted one of his crowning masterpieces, interweaving a moving and unusual coming-of-age story with a morally tangled chronicle of modern espionage.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1i1b1jWKsEsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[j],firstBook:c,published:"2011-07-20",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940946272}}("The Constant Gardener","",null,"A Novel","Frightening, heartbreaking, and exquisitely calibrated, John le Carré's new novel opens with the gruesome murder of the young and beautiful Tessa Quayle near northern Kenya's Lake Turkana, the birthplace of mankind. Her putative African lover and traveling companion, a doctor with one of the aid agencies, has vanished from the scene of the crime. Tessa's much older husband, Justin, a career diplomat at the British High Commission in Nairobi, sets out on a personal odyssey in pursuit of the killers and their motive. A master chronicler of the deceptions and betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, le Carré portrays, in The Constant Gardener, the dark side of unbridled capitalism. His eighteenth novel is also the profoundly moving story of a man whom tragedy elevates. Justin Quayle, amateur gardener and ineffectual bureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to his wife's cause, discovers his own resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love. The Constant Gardener is a magnificent exploration of the new world order by one of the most compelling and elegant storytellers of our time.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Dn5gAx1PFqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","John le Carre","2005-08-01","Simon and Schuster","John le Carré"))
