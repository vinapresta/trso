The two travel about Arkansas, selling their socks and bumping into a variety of simple souls, including the eponymous mythic killer, who has engaged himself to Apple Lisa Weed and disavowed his life as a murderer. Morales Pittman joins forces with Miss Apple Lisa's dim-witted brother, Reggie, to extort money from the local bumpkins, to the annoyance of the reigning provider of \"protection,\" Mr. Pines.
