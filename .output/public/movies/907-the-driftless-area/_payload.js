A New York Magazine and Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year With extensive excerpts appearing in the New Yorker before its release, Tom Drury’s groundbreaking debut, The End of Vandalism, drew widespread acclaim and comparison to the works of Sherwood Anderson and William Faulkner. With his fictional Grouse County, Tom Drury conjures a Midwest that is at once familiar and amusingly eccentric—where a thief vacuums the church before stealing the chalice, a lonely woman paints her toenails in a drafty farmhouse, and a sleepless man watches his restless bride scatter their bills beneath the stars. When Sheriff Dan Norman arrests Tiny Darling for vandalizing an anti–vandalism dance, he goes on to marry the culprit’s ex-wife Louise. But while Tiny loses Louise, Louise loses her sense of self—and all three find themselves in a love triangle that sets them on an epic journey. “A truly great writer.” —Esquire “Grouse County is unabashedly American, a setting both nostalgic and wittily contemporary.” —The Boston Globe",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wSIXk0Q60PsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2007-12-01",publisher:"Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc.",subtitle:g}},{id:5456,attributes:{title:"La region inmovil \u002F The Driftless Area",description:"A young bartender, Pierre Hunter, falls in love with the mysterious Stella Rosmarin and, after finding himself in sudden possession of a stolen bundle of money, he becomes the central figure in a revenge drama that he must unravel.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IL-8QQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2009-01-01",publisher:c,subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069510889}}("movie","Tom Drury","","series",null,"The Driftless Area","A Novel",1,"From the award-winning author of The End of Vandalism. “Equal parts heist caper, ghost story and romance . . . in prose that is spare and sly.” (The New York Times) Set in the rugged region of the Midwest that gives the novel its title, The Driftless Area is the story of Pierre Hunter, a young bartender with unfailing optimism, a fondness for coin tricks, and an uncanny capacity for finding trouble. When he falls in love, with the mysterious and isolated Stella Rosmarin, Pierre becomes the central player in a revenge drama he must unravel and bring to its shocking conclusion. Along the way he will liberate $77,000 from a murderous thief, summon the resources that have eluded him all his life, and come to question the very meaning of chance and mortality. For nothing is as it seems in The Driftless Area. Identities shift, violent secrets lie in wait, the future can cause the past, and love becomes a mission that can take you beyond this world. In its tender, cool irony, The Driftless Area recalls the best of neonoir, and its cast of bona fide small-town eccentrics adrift in the American Midwest make for a clever and deeply pleasurable read from one of our most beloved authors. “Drury is nothing less than a wizard . . . Not since Twin Peaks has he rural surreal had such an artful airing.” —The Boston Globe “Superb . . . by one of America’s finest, most imaginative authors.” —San Francisco Chronicle “With deceptively simple prose, Drury is able to evoke characters and scenes in just a few brush strokes.” —Los Angeles Times","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GOgVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2012-11-27","Open Road + Grove\u002FAtlantic"))
