SJ Watson says he was &#39;hooked from the very beginning and haunted for days&#39; and CJ Tudor was captivated by &#39;a twist that will make your head explode&#39;. The Feed was everything, until it was gone. Tom and Kate have managed to survive in an unconnected world, but the search for their abducted daughter reveals what they have lost. Without the Feed, no one knows who you are. No one knows who to trust. Without it, how can their daughter be saved? What readers are saying about The Feed: &#39;Absolutely terrifying. It is incredibly real and wholly recognisable&#39; &#39;Gripping and exciting and all too close for comfort. Very realistic and beautifully written&#39; &#39;A harrowing tale, at times moving, at times thoughtful, at times harsh. It will keep you coming back for more with characters that feel real, a vivid landscape and stellar thought-provoking story&#39; &#39;This is not a book you can start reading and put back down so be prepared to lose some sleep over this one!&#39;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb6189"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=7IMnDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Feed" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Feed</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Nick Clark Windo<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by HarperCollins</span><span><span> - </span>3/13/2018</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>“Think The Road intricately wrapped around Station Eleven with a dash of Oryx and Crake...Windo pushes all the right buttons in this post-apocalyptic mashup.” -- Kirkus Set in a post-apocalyptic world as unique and vividly imagined as those of Mad Max and The Girl with All the Gifts, a startling and timely debut that explores what it is to be human and what it truly means to be connected in the digital age.
