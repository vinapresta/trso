For centuries, stories of pirates have captured imaginations around the world. The recent ragtag bands of pirates off the coast of Somalia, hijacking multimillion-dollar tankers owned by international shipping conglomerates, have brought the scourge of piracy into the modern era. Jay Bahadur’s riveting narrative exposé—the first of its kind—looks at who these men are, how they live, the forces that created piracy in Somalia, how the pirates spend the ransom money, how they deal with their hostages, among much, much more. It is a revelation of a dangerous world at the epicenter of political and natural disaster.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=6zlXzrtxis4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-07-19","Vintage","Inside Their Hidden World","What are the lives of modern day pirates like outside of the attack skiffs? How do they spend their money? What clothes do they wear and what is their drug of choice? Deadly Waters takes us to the heart of Somalia, where Jay Bahadur, the intrepid twenty-five-year-old author has ventured where most journalists fear to tread. As the 'go to' journalist for all media, and with unparalleled access to all the major players, from government officials to local residents - and of course the pirates themselves - Bahadur sets out to discover who is behind the masked menaces who appear on the news. Exploring the politics and history of the self-governing region of Puntland, Bahadur looks at the challenges facing this troubled mini-state as piracy rises - and examines how the UN and other bodies are attempting to deal with the scourge of every sea-faring nation. Evocative and incisive, Deadly Waters is a highly original analysis of the international pirate crisis.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=5w3vg0v4fOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-06-02","Profile Books","Inside the hidden world of Somalia's pirates"))
