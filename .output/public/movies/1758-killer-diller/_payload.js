His fathering advice, pre-birth through schooling, involves plenty of his trademark humor, but also sound guidance enhanced by his training and experience as an educator. Papa Edgerton suggests that on occasion a father might forego reading and just point to the pictures of dogs and cats in baby books, and also that he might place a blanket on the lawn, lie on his back with the whole family, and watch Sky Television. Edgerton's humorous and helpful counsel will guide new parents on interacting with in-laws and coping with sleep deprivation, while also providing strategies for recovery after you've cursed in front of a mimicking baby. \"If you don't feel apprehensive just before your first child is to arrive, you are abnormal,\" writes Edgerton. Yet by way of his experience, observation, and imagination, he provides caution and pure joy in equal measure. \"Edgerton is so, so funny. He captures the rainbows, cheap thrills, and irritating potholes of parenting with splendid understatement.\"-Library Journal",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yZk4AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2013-05-07",publisher:i,subtitle:"Advice to Dads of All Ages"}},{id:9013,attributes:{title:"Where Trouble Sleeps",description:"A story set in rural North Carolina town in 1950 follows the interwined fates of a devious drifter, a beautiful waitress, and a boy from a religiously strict home",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=uqIAidZDvJUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1998-01-01",publisher:h,subtitle:j}},{id:9014,attributes:{title:"The Bible Salesman",description:"Preston Clearwater has been a criminal since stealing two chain saws and 1600 pairs of aviator sunglasses from the Army during the Second World War. Back on the road in post-war North Carolina, a member of a car-theft ring, he picks up hitch-hiking Henry Dampier, an innocent nineteen-year-old Bible salesman. Clearwater immediately recognizes Henry as just the associate he needs -- one who will believe is working as an F.B.I. spy; one who will drive the cars Clearwater steals as Clearwater follows along in another car at a safe distance. Henry joyfully sees a chance to lead a dual life as Bible salesman and a G-man. During his hilarious and scary adventures we learn of Henry's fundamentalist youth, an upbringing that doesn't prepare him for his new life. As he falls in love and questions his religious training, Henry begins to see he's being used -- that the fun and games are over, that he is on his own in a way he never imagined.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=cbw2AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2008-08-11",publisher:i,subtitle:j}},{id:9015,attributes:{title:"Walking Across Egypt",description:"\" An unpretentious, finely-crafted novel that will linger with the readers like the last strains of a favorite hymn.
