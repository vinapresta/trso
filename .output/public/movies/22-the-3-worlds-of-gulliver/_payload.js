One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries. The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford- able hardbound editions of impor- tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy- fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torch- bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau- gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices. As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: \"Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement. Swift had not only the judgment with which to arrive at a reasoned view of the world but the fancy by means of which he could re-create that world in a form which teaches where argument fails and which satisfies all while misleading none.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hqsJKvM17WwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2010-11-02",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:a}},{id:1820,attributes:{title:"Gulliver's Travels and Other Writings",description:"The voyages of an eighteenth-century Englishman carry him to such strange places as Lilliput, where people are six inches tall, and Brobdingnag, a land peopled by giants, in the classic satirical novel, accompanied by such writings as \"The Battle of the Books,\" \"A Modest Proposal,\" \"An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity,\" and other essays, poems, and satire.

Through the misadventures of Lemuel Gulliver, his hopelessly \"modern\" protagonist, Swift exposes many of the follies of the English Enlightenment, from its worship of science to its neglect of traditional philosophy and theology. In Swift's eighteenth century, as in our twenty-first, a war being fought between the \"ancients\"and the \"moderns\", between those rooted in the traditions of the West and those seeking to uproot tradition to make way for dangerous and ultimatcly destructive new ideas. Swift's satire on the threats posed by the Enlightenment and the embryonic spirit of secular fundamentalism makes Gulliver's Travels priceless reading for today's defenders of tradition. Yet Swift's subtlety has bemused many modern critics, with the lamentable of result that this classic of western civilization is often misread and misunderstood. This new critical edition, edited by Dutton kearney of Aquinas College in Nashville, contains detailed notes to the text, bringing it to life for today's reader, and a selection of tradition-oriented essays by some of the finest contemporay Swift scholars. The Ignatius Critical Editions Series represents a tradition-oriented approach to reading the Classics of world literature. While many modern critical editions have succumbed to the fads of modernism and post-modernism, this series concentrates on critical examinations informed by our Judco-Christian heritage as passed down through the ages---the same heritage that provided the crucible in which the great authors formed these classic works. Edited by acclaimed literary biographer Joseph Pearce, the lgnatius Critical Editions ensure that readings of the works are filtered through the richness of Western tradition, meeting the authors in their clement, instead of the currently popular method of deconstructing a classic to fit a modern mindsct---a lamentable flaw that often proliferates in other series of critical editions. The Series is ideal for anyone wishing to understand the great works of Western Civilization, enabling the modern reader to enjoy these classics in the company of some of the finest literature professors alive today.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=3KTxJd9j3zIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2010-01-01",publisher:"Ignatius Press",subtitle:"With an Introduction and Contemporary Criticism"}},{id:1823,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ta1uaL7RF5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"1826-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568341041}}("","Jonathan Swift","movie","Gulliver's Travels",null,"series",1))
