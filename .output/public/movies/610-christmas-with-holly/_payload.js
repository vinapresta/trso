Rainshadow Road Lucy Marinn is a glass artist living in Friday Harbor, Washington, with a boyfriend who she believes is her soul mate. She has always had a magical side—a gift that finds its way into the glasswork she creates—and she struggles to keep it contained. But then Lucy is blindsided when her boyfriend leaves her and his new lover is none other than Lucy's own sister. Questions about love, loyalty, old patterns, mistakes, and new beginnings are explored as Lucy learns that some things in life—even after being broken—can be re-made into something beautiful. And that it is only by discovering who you really are that you can find the one who truly deserves you.

He battles his demons with the help of a whiskey bottle, and he lives in his own private hell. And then, a ghost shows up. Only Alex can see him. Has he finally crossed over the threshold to insanity? When Zoë Hoffman meets the startlingly gorgeous Alex Nolan, all her instincts tell her to run. But she somehow manages to open his mind to the possibility that old ghosts can breathe new life into a broken soul—and that love can reach beyond time, space, and reason to take hold of hearts that yearn for it. . .
