The memo proposed blackmailing smaller, undecided member states into voting for war. At great personal and professional risk, journalist Martin Bright published the leaked document in The Observer newspaper in London, and the story made headlines around the world. Members of the Security Council were outraged and any chance of a UN resolution in favour of war collapsed. But within days, Bush declared he no longer needed UN backing and invaded anyway. As Iraq descended into chaos, Katharine was arrested and charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act. Martin faced potential charges too. Their legal battles exposed the highest levels of government in both London and Washington with having manipulated intelligence in order to sell an illegal war.",slug:"official-secrets"}}},books:{data:[{id:9761,attributes:{title:a,description:b,thumbnail:c,authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:e,publisher:c,subtitle:f}},{id:9762,attributes:{title:a,description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=PMwMAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d,"Thomas Mitchell"],firstBook:null,published:e,publisher:"Polipoint Press",subtitle:f}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940951588}}("The Spy who Tried to Stop a War","\"Tells the story of a young British secret service officer, Katharine Gun, and her courageous decision to expose an illegal US-UK operation -- a covert plot to influence the UN vote that would have authorized the Iraq invasion\"--P.
