Paul Galambos is an ordinary professor of psychology, struggling to glean any degree of satisfaction or success from his family and his career—until one day he is recruited by a top-secret organization and given carte blanche to pursue experiments and studies as he sees fit, no longer confined to lab rats. This is the life that Paul was destined for, replete with money and respect, if only he can ignore the incessant pull of his conscience. Alternately funny and chilling, Last Night at the Brain Thieves Ball delves into the ethical issues surrounding science and the perils of ambition, and exposes the narcissistic tendencies of humankind.
