Though the main character, Herbert White is a necrophiliac, and a killer, the poem - and the film - are an expression of life's isolation and loneliness. A poem became a film. In the rest of book, Franco uses poems to express what he feels about film: about acting; about the actors he admires - James Dean, Marlon Brando, Sean Penn; about the cult of celebrity and his struggles with it; about his teenage years in Palo Alto, and about mortality prompted by the death of his father. These preoccupations are handled with a simplicity and directness that recalls the work of Frank O'Hara.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-drGAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2014-07-01",publisher:"Faber & Faber",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703436270}}("","James Franco","movie","Actors Anonymous",null,"series",1,"A darkly comic tale by the actor, artist and author of Pao Alto is told in the style of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step testimonials, scripts, letters, diary entries and other forms that explore the nature and purpose of acting while sharing moving and satirical portraits of actors who did not achieve fame.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vSCqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2013-01-01","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"))
