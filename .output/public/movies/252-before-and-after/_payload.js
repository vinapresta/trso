Best known for her carefully crafted, emotionally resonant novels, Rosellen Brown is committed to the ideal of the well-rounded writer. She shifts easily from prose to poetry, from fiction to nonfiction, from novels to short stories with an assured mastery of each form that enriches her work in the others. This Reader is the first book to bring together her work in a variety of genres, presenting many previously uncollected stories and essays. The collection reveals the wide range of her imagination and the evolution of her central themes. Like a pilot flying low over the land, she writes in her introduction, I've finally been able to study what my 'central work, ' my novels, can't teach me--the general shape of my preoccupations across the years; the rises and declivities of skill, curiosity, casual engagement, and inescapable obsession. Intermixing clusters of short stories, poetry, and essays, Brown creates a collage of her own writing in which certain themes--the struggle for self-definition in terms of gender, ethnic heritage, or sense of place; the responsibilities of human beings to one another; the constant challenge of adapting to changing circumstances--recur in the midst of experimentation in form, voice, and structure. In a final interview, she says, ultimately, all of our work will be seen from a distance, like a view of the earth from above, and it will turn out that the shape and size of this or that body of writing will look wholly different from up there. This Reader is our first step in gaining that elevatedperspective on a distinguished career.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=c59AGXOvBW8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1993-10-01",publisher:"Middlebury College",subtitle:"Selected Poetry and Prose"}},{id:2783,attributes:{title:c,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:g}},{id:2784,attributes:{title:"Cora Fry's Pillow Book",description:"Through the persona of Cora Fry, a wife and mother living in a small New Hampshire town, Rosellen Brown explores the ambivalent ties of love, loyalty, marriage, and family in a series of related poems.

Before and After centers on Carolyn and Ben Reiser and their two children, Judith and Jacob, who live comfortably in a small New England town. When the chief of police comes looking for seventeen-year-old Jacob to question him about the bludgeoning to death of his girlfriend, the Reisers' lives are changed forever. Before and After is the compelling drama of the search for Jacob, his capture, and the chain of events set in motion by a brutal crime of passion. It is a story that pits parent against parent, brother against sister, family against community, blood loyalty against the law. With a flawless ear for dialogue and profound understanding of character and motive, Rosellen Brown has written a heart-wrenching novel that questions the very nature of violence in our society and our ability to ever really know our children.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=a65mAP2FiVUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
