Best known for her carefully crafted, emotionally resonant novels, Rosellen Brown is committed to the ideal of the well-rounded writer. She shifts easily from prose to poetry, from fiction to nonfiction, from novels to short stories with an assured mastery of each form that enriches her work in the others. This Reader is the first book to bring together her work in a variety of genres, presenting many previously uncollected stories and essays. The collection reveals the wide range of her imagination and the evolution of her central themes. Like a pilot flying low over the land, she writes in her introduction, I&#39;ve finally been able to study what my &#39;central work, &#39; my novels, can&#39;t teach me--the general shape of my preoccupations across the years; the rises and declivities of skill, curiosity, casual engagement, and inescapable obsession. Intermixing clusters of short stories, poetry, and essays, Brown creates a collage of her own writing in which certain themes--the struggle for self-definition in terms of gender, ethnic heritage, or sense of place; the responsibilities of human beings to one another; the constant challenge of adapting to changing circumstances--recur in the midst of experimentation in form, voice, and structure. In a final interview, she says, ultimately, all of our work will be seen from a distance, like a view of the earth from above, and it will turn out that the shape and size of this or that body of writing will look wholly different from up there. This Reader is our first step in gaining that elevatedperspective on a distinguished career.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2783"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=a65mAP2FiVUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Before and After" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Before and After</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Rosellen Brown<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux</span><span><span> - </span>3/1/2005</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Beautifully written, compassionate and wise, Rosellen Brown&#39;s novel is the extraordinary story of a family&#39;s struggle to survive the throes of a tragedy.

A sequel of newer poems, Cora Fry&#39;s Pillow Book (1994), confronts the challenges that come with a woman&#39;s growth toward middle age, reflecting an older Cora&#39;s place in her family, community, and the larger world.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJmODIwYWUtNTNkYy00Njk4LWJkODktMzA5ZTdkMTZhZmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Before and After" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Before and After is based on the book Before and After? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">When teenage son Jacob is being accused of murdering his girlfriend, the well-respected and close-knit Ryan family is in turmoil.
