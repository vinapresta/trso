Over the span of a half-century - from the early 1930s to the early 1980s - the Italian-American Fante (1909-1983) wrote short stories and novels that drew on his own life from his Catholic childhood in Colorado through his down-and-out days in Los Angeles, to his adventures as a screenwriter in Hollywood. He writes about all these things with gusto, humor, directness, and an honesty tinged with the irony of a true modernist.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bSXoUxx93F4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Long Beach) John Fante Conference (1995 California State University"],firstBook:c,published:"1999-01-01",publisher:"Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press",subtitle:"A Critical Gathering"}},{id:972,attributes:{title:"The John Fante Reader",description:"It's not every day that a writer, almost unheard of in his lifetime, emerges twenty years after his death as a voice of his generation. But then again, there aren't many writers with such irrepressible genius as John Fante. The John Fante Reader is the important next step in the reintroduction of this influential author to modern audiences. Combining excerpts from his novels and stories, as well as his never-before-published letters, this collection is the perfect primer on the work of a writer -- underappreciated in his time -- who is finally taking his place in the pantheon of twentieth-century American writers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=h4-VbGxbRm8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,f],firstBook:c,published:"2010-09-14",publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:973,attributes:{title:"Fante\u002FMencken",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=swZbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,"Henry Louis Mencken","Joyce Fante"],firstBook:c,published:"1989-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:"John Fante & H.L.

The contributors to this work—writers, critics, fans, scholars, screenwriters, directors, and others—analyze the provocative set of diaspora tensions informing Fante’s masterpiece that distinguish it from those accounts of earlier East Coast migrations and minglings. A must-read for aficionados of L.A. fiction and new migration literature, John Fante’s “Ask the Dust”: A Joining of Voices and Views is destined for landmark status as the first volume of Fante studies to reveal the novel’s evolving intertextualities and intersectionalities.
