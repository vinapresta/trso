The pair meet when 'Mose' stops by the sparsely-attended funeral in Kansas of a woman he once knew (we never see her). In attendance, is the woman's young daughter, Addie, whom Moses agrees to transport to St Joseph, Mo -- for money, of course. Mose - an inveterate hustler, has been working ostensibly as a representative of the Kansas Bible Company - who picks his marks from the obits, and tries to sell - at exorbitant prices - the decedents' spouse the custom bible they'd previously ordered. Wise beyond her years, Addie picks up on Moses' grift, and very quickly, she and Mose become a team. Traveling from town to town, making money in every dishonest way imaginable, and looking for the ultimate score. The colorful characters they meet along the way make the film all the more interesting. One in particular - Miss Trixie Delight - an exotic dancer who Mose rescues from a traveling carnival and the girl who works for her, poor, suffering Imogene. Addie sees Miss Delight as a potential rival, and she concocts a plan with Imogene to free themselves of her. The film's peppered with regional dialogue, one of the most memorable line's uttered when Mose is forced to wrestle a backwoodsman in order to trade his new car for the hillbilly's battered old truck; \"make him say calf-rope, Leroy!\" one of the observers calls out. Paper Moon, directed by Peter Bogdonovich is adapted from the novel, \"Addie Pray\" (1971) by Joe David Brown.",slug:"paper-moon"}}},books:{data:[{id:10065,attributes:{title:"Paper Moon:formerly Addie Pray",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:c,publisher:a,subtitle:e}},{id:10066,attributes:{title:f,description:g,thumbnail:h,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:c,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10067,attributes:{title:f,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1972-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:e}},{id:10068,attributes:{title:f,description:g,thumbnail:h,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:c,publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10069,attributes:{title:"Paper Moon; Formerly Titled Addie Pray",description:"Young Addie Pray and \"Long Boy\" travel the backroads of the South fleecing as many citizens as the traffic will allow.",thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:c,publisher:a,subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940947787}}("","Joe David Brown","1971-01-01",null,"A Novel","Addie Pray","\"Addie Pray, eleven, and her father are con artists who travel the South before they join a more sophisticated schemer who plans their ultimate con.\" *** \"The death of eleven-year-old Addie Pray's mother leaves her in the care of Long Boy, a man who may or may not be her biological father, and together they set out to con their way through the Deep South in the middle of the Great Depression.\"","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2c4fAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"))
