In his remote Adirondack retreat, he is tended by servants dressed in black and green, the color of West’s empire—and of money. The son of an Irish powerbroker of the rough-and-tumble Lower East Side, West has been forging his kingdom since the day his father died, leaving him with a small fortune, a few bordellos, and a burning hunger to escape New York and make his mark upon the world—a mark he will leave in blood. The moment Congress passes Prohibition, West sets about building a one-man monopoly of bootlegging, smuggling, and murder.

There are only two people on earth who know that James Bourne is a criminal: his wife and his partner. Although he may be the most distinguished crook in Europe, Bourne has never been arrested. The thieves of London don’t know his name, nor do the dons of Sicily or the police of Paris. A master thief, he’s patient, careful, and utterly discreet—but he’s about to meet his match. A handful of masterpieces adorn the walls of the palace belonging to the richest woman in Spain, and although she’s a friend of Bourne’s, he has never let a personal relationship get in the way of business. He plans to steal a few of the paintings, replacing them with impeccable forgeries made by his Parisian partner. But even the craftiest crook can be outsmarted, and this heist is about to turn deadly.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dRXyCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
