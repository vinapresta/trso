Mr. and Mrs. Fang called it art. Their children called it mischief. Performance artists Caleb and Camille Fang dedicated themselves to making great art. But when an artistâs work lies in subverting normality, it can be difficult to raise well-adjusted children. Just ask Buster and Annie Fang. For as long as they can remember, they starred (unwillingly) in their parentsâ madcap pieces. But now that they are grown up, the chaos of their childhood has made it difficult to cope with life outside the fishbowl of their parentsâ strange world. When the lives theyâve built come crashing down, brother and sister have nowhere to go but home, where they discover that Caleb and Camille are planning one last performance-their magnum opus-whether the kids agree to participate or not. Soon, ambition breeds conflict, bringing the Fangs to face the difficult decision about whatâs ultimately more important: their family or their art. Filled with Kevin Wilsonâs endless creativity, vibrant prose, sharp humor, and keen sense of the complex performances that unfold in the relationships of people who love one another, The Family Fang is a masterfully executed tale that is as bizarre as it is touching.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb6033"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=rpB0PsaRRdoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Family Fang" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Family Fang</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Kevin Wilson<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Harper Collins</span><span><span> - </span>8/9/2011</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, Jason Bateman and Christopher Walken. âThe Family Fang is a comedy, a tragedy, and a tour-de-force examination of what it means to make art and survive your familyâ¦.The best single word description would be brilliant.â âAnn Patchett, author of Bel Canto âItâs The Royal Tenenbaums meets Whoâs Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

[His] writing has a Houdini-like perfection, wherein no matter how grim the variables, each lovely sentence manages to escape with all its parts intact.â âBoston Globe When Isabelle Poole meets Dr. Preston Grind, sheâs fresh out of high school, pregnant with her art teacher&#39;s baby, and totally on her own. Izzy knows she can be a good mother but without any money or relatives to help, sheâs left searching. Dr. Grind, an awkwardly charming child psychologist, has spent his life studying family, even after tragedy struck his own. Now, with the help of an eccentric billionaire, he has the chance to create a âperfect little worldââto study what would happen when ten children are raised collectively, without knowing who their biological parents are. He calls it The Infinite Family Project and he wants Izzy and her son to join. This attempt at a utopian ideal starts off promising, but soon the gentle equilibrium among the families disintegrates: unspoken resentments between the couples begin to fester; the project&#39;s funding becomes tenuous; and Izzyâs growing feelings for Dr. Grind make her question her participation in this strange experiment in the first place. Written with the same compassion and charm that won over legions of readers with The Family Fang, Kevin Wilson shows us with grace and humor that the best families are the ones we make for ourselves.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb6035"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=M0CGDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Nothing to See Here" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Nothing to See Here</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Kevin Wilson<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by HarperCollins</span><span><span> - </span>10/29/2019</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>A New York Times Bestseller â¢ A Read with Jenna Today Show Book Club Pick!

Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and theyâve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help. Madisonâs twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, thereâs a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but itâs the truth. Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each otherâand stay coolâwhile also staying out of the way of Madisonâs buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need herâurgently and fiercely. Couldnât this be the start of the amazing life sheâd always hoped for? With white-hot wit and a big, tender heart, Kevin Wilson has written his best book yetâa most unusual story of parental love.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODk5NTY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI4Mjg1ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster The Family Fang" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie The Family Fang is based on the book The Family Fang? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Annie and Baxter, the adult children of the controversial husband and wife conceptual performance art couple famous for their quirky macabre public performances, have never got over the fact that their parents kept using them during their childhood in their often gory and disturbing satirical public performances.
