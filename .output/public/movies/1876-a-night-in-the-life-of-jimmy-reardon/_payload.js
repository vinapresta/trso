The answer to these questions hurl a rather desperate 17 year old Jimmy Reardon, from the wrong side of the tracks in a posh Chicago suburb, on a 24 hour odessy as he tries to borrow from his \"Saturday Habit\" girl and his true girlfriend Lisa along with attempting a bit of a con on his employer and his employer's mother -- while along the way managing to seduce his father's mistress and get a beating from the school Hero -- a picaresque anti-hero is Jimmy Reardon, who finds himself in his search for escape. The book received rave reviews upon publication, with prose favorably compared to James Joyce and Kingsley Amis among others, and its author William Richert was feted by Enest Hemingway's wife as an heir apparent to the famous author. Mr. Richert never wrote another novel, and became a screenwriter, director and actor. AREN'T YOU EVEN GONNA KISS ME GOODBYE?, a Kirkus Library Review top choice in 1966, was made into a film by William Richert in the 80's starring River Phoenix and a superb cast topped by Ann Magnuson, Meredith Salenger, Louanne, Matthew Perry, Ione Skye and Jason Court. \"As sweet as a dry Manhattan with twice the kick,\" wrote Shiela Benson in the LA Times.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QQ22tgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2017-11-16",publisher:"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform",subtitle:e}},{id:9509,attributes:{title:"My Beauty My Beast",description:"Author and Director William Richert tells the original tale of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST for the first time since 1740, when the story of how a Prince was changed into a Beast until somebody loved him for his soul, and not for his physical appearance. The creation of the Beast as part of a fairy tale first came into being in Paris among the aristocrats of the time as a way to explain, perhaps, the relationships of younger women to older men. In time the story grew and changed into the present Walt Disney incarnation. But the roots of the story are steeped in pagan literature, and the truth of the transformation from handsome prince, to beast, and back again, has lessons for all time and place. The illustrations are by the great American illustrator River Sauts, whose works hang in the Vatican, among other spots. William Richert's film and book credits include AREN'T YOU EVEN GONNA KISS ME GOODBYE?, which he wrote and directed as a film starring River Phoenix and introducing Matthew Perry and Johnny Galecki. Also Mr. Richert wrote and directed WINTER KILLS starring Jeff Bridges and John Huston, which the New York Times called \"One of the Great all-time American Films -- ranks with Citizen Kane.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BucYjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2015-09-14",publisher:g,subtitle:"The Graphic Beauty and the Beast"}},{id:9510,attributes:{title:"What Generals Do at Night",description:"Fiery evangelistic General Arnold \"Red Dog\" Sorkin is commander of the Rockland Air Force Base in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he discovers his base is about to be shut down in a Pentagon cost-cutting, he and a few of his fellow officers who grew up in the South and long for an underground \"New Confederacy\" decide to blackmail the nation by re-directing their nuclear Minutemen ICBM missiles towards New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. As they attempt to enter the silos and re-direct the missiles, emissaries are sent to Senator Manning, the Speaker of the House, preparing him to step into the Presidency when the President leaves the White House, which he must do under such an imminent and catastrophic threat from the military. Against the leaders of the coup, the Air Force dispatches one of its best, General \"Ace\" Yeager, who flies to the mutinous base but is captured by the rogue General. But all is not lost. Hot on the trail of the mutineers is Detective Frank Zabrinski of the Philadelphia Police Department. This is a fast paced thriller which William Richert calls a \"Cinema Novella\" or a screen-play in prose, meant to be read on the page or acted out. If the style is reminiscent of Stanly Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove,\" it is purposeful -- \"I want to connect the reader to the warnings from the past by other artists regarding the inherent dangers of each and every nuclear weapon. They all have got to be exterminated, and the cinema can reach almost everybody -- even a 'Cinema Novella' like mine.\" WHAT GENERALS DO AT NIGHT provides maximum reading entertainment for informative propaganda about the dangers of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. Although the Air Force Generals are villains in the book, they are the heroes, too, as every man and woman in the novel seems to want to do \"right\" by herself and the country. \"It is knowing what catastrophic dangers are lurking in the soil with 26,000 active ICBM sites across the U.S. that prompted me to write this novella. And it is the knowledgeable who will most be interested. But it is the ignorant we have to reach, urgently, as soon as possible, on behalf of all of us.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=L8w0jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2015-09-03",publisher:g,subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377284702}}("movie","William Richert","series",1,"",null,"CreateSpace"))
