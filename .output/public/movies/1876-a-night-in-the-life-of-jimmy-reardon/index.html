The creation of the Beast as part of a fairy tale first came into being in Paris among the aristocrats of the time as a way to explain, perhaps, the relationships of younger women to older men. In time the story grew and changed into the present Walt Disney incarnation. But the roots of the story are steeped in pagan literature, and the truth of the transformation from handsome prince, to beast, and back again, has lessons for all time and place. The illustrations are by the great American illustrator River Sauts, whose works hang in the Vatican, among other spots. William Richert&#39;s film and book credits include AREN&#39;T YOU EVEN GONNA KISS ME GOODBYE?, which he wrote and directed as a film starring River Phoenix and introducing Matthew Perry and Johnny Galecki. Also Mr. Richert wrote and directed WINTER KILLS starring Jeff Bridges and John Huston, which the New York Times called &quot;One of the Great all-time American Films -- ranks with Citizen Kane.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9510"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=L8w0jgEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book What Generals Do at Night" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>What Generals Do at Night</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->William Richert<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by CreateSpace</span><span><span> - </span>9/3/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Fiery evangelistic General Arnold &quot;Red Dog&quot; Sorkin is commander of the Rockland Air Force Base in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he discovers his base is about to be shut down in a Pentagon cost-cutting, he and a few of his fellow officers who grew up in the South and long for an underground &quot;New Confederacy&quot; decide to blackmail the nation by re-directing their nuclear Minutemen ICBM missiles towards New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. As they attempt to enter the silos and re-direct the missiles, emissaries are sent to Senator Manning, the Speaker of the House, preparing him to step into the Presidency when the President leaves the White House, which he must do under such an imminent and catastrophic threat from the military. Against the leaders of the coup, the Air Force dispatches one of its best, General &quot;Ace&quot; Yeager, who flies to the mutinous base but is captured by the rogue General. But all is not lost. Hot on the trail of the mutineers is Detective Frank Zabrinski of the Philadelphia Police Department. This is a fast paced thriller which William Richert calls a &quot;Cinema Novella&quot; or a screen-play in prose, meant to be read on the page or acted out. If the style is reminiscent of Stanly Kubrick&#39;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot; it is purposeful -- &quot;I want to connect the reader to the warnings from the past by other artists regarding the inherent dangers of each and every nuclear weapon. They all have got to be exterminated, and the cinema can reach almost everybody -- even a &#39;Cinema Novella&#39; like mine.&quot; WHAT GENERALS DO AT NIGHT provides maximum reading entertainment for informative propaganda about the dangers of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. Although the Air Force Generals are villains in the book, they are the heroes, too, as every man and woman in the novel seems to want to do &quot;right&quot; by herself and the country. &quot;It is knowing what catastrophic dangers are lurking in the soil with 26,000 active ICBM sites across the U.S. that prompted me to write this novella. And it is the knowledgeable who will most be interested. But it is the ignorant we have to reach, urgently, as soon as possible, on behalf of all of us.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3YWQ1OGEtN2NiMi00NmRiLTkyMjUtZjViMjlmNzQwMjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon is based on the book Aren&#39;t You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">A recent high school graduate is faced with two options, either go to a business school where his father wants him to go to, or get a full time job.
