Font adjustments & biography included Unabridged (100% Original content) Illustrated About Her Father's Daughter by Gene Stratton-Porter In Her Father's Daughter by Gene Stratton-Porter, Stratton-Porter tells the coming-of-age story of high school student Linda Strong as she discovers boys, finds the gumption to stand up to her older sister, and comes to terms with the tragic death of her parents. Linda is a smart, accomplished tomboy character who is polar opposites with her sister. The story has a fairy-tale quality to it; Linda is the put-upon, neglected orphan. Her fashionable older sister hoards all the money for her own use and is a real two-faced conniver when it comes to men and friendships. This book is super entertaining and you will love how Linda is an accomplished naturalist. This book was written at the end of World War I, when the country was recovering from a devastating chapter in its history. With this backdrop, Gene wrote material that would make her a legend. She was one of the leading movie producers in Hollywood and this could have been the start of a romantic picture. Stratton-Porter was an American feminist, environmentalist, photographer and one of Indiana's most famous female authors. Many of her writings were moralistic and romantic novels. This book tells the story of two orphaned sisters (who it later turns out are not really sisters). The introductory paragraphs set the tone: What makes you wear such funny shoes? Linda Strong thrust forward a foot and critically examined the narrow vamp, the projecting sole, the broad, low heel of her well-worn brown calfskin shoe. Then her glance lifted to the face of Donald Whiting, one of the most brilliant and popular seniors of the High School. Her eyes narrowed in a manner habitual to her when thinking intently. Never you mind my shoes, she said deliberately.
