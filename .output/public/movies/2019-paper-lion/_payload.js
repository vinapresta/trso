George Plimpton was perhaps best known for Paper Lion, the book that set the bar for participatory sports journalism. With his characteristic wit, Plimpton recounts his experiences in talking his way into training camp with the Detroit Lions, practicing with the team, and taking snaps behind center. His breezy style captures the pressures and tensions rookies confront, the hijinks that pervade when sixty high-strung guys live together in close quarters, and a host of football rites and rituals. One of the funniest and most insightful books ever written on football, Paper Lion is a classic look at the gridiron game and a book The Wall Street Journal calls \"a continuous feast...The best book ever about football -- or anything!\"","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=D-ssCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2016-04-26","Hachette UK"))
