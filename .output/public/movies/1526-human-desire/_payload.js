Vicki Buckley is the sultry wife of brutish railroad supervisor Carl Buckley, an alcoholic wife beater with a hair trigger temper and penchant for explosive violence. After Buckley is fired for insubordination, he begs Vicki to intercede on his behalf with John Owens, a rich and powerful businessman, for whom Vicki's mother used to keep house and whose influence can get him reinstated. When Buckley suspects she has used sexual favors to persuade Owens, he beats Vicki and develops a plan to meet Owens on the train and stabs him to death in a jealous rage in his compartment. Jeff, who is deadheading after a trip, is on the train and meets Vicki without knowing who she is, when Buckley needs her to get him out of the way so he can get back to their compartment without being seen as he is covered in blood. Jeff is a potential witness to the homicide and becomes an accessory after the fact due to his attraction for Vicki. Jeff and Vicki begin an affair, while Vicki plots to get away from her abusive husband and recover the evidence that links her to the murder.",slug:"human-desire"}}},books:{data:[{id:8013,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:8014,attributes:{title:"La Bete Humaine",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Emile ZOLA"],firstBook:d,published:"1977-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:8015,attributes:{title:"Zola's La Bête Humaine",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pnsOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Martin Kanes",c],firstBook:d,published:"1962-01-01",publisher:"Berkeley : University of California Press",subtitle:"A Study in Literary Creation"}},{id:8016,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:8017,attributes:{title:"The Monomaniac (La bête humaine)",description:"\"The Monomaniac (La bête humaine)\" by Émile Zola (translated by Edward Vizetelly).

La Bete humaine (1890), is one of Zola's most violent and explicit works. On one level a tale of murder, passion and possession, it is also a compassionate study of individuals derailed by atavistic forces beyond their control. Zola considered this his `most finely worked' novel, and in it he powerfully evokes life at the end of the Second Empire in France, where society seemed to be hurtling into the future like the new locomotives and railways it was building. While expressing the hope that human nature evolves through education and gradually frees itself of the burden of inherited evil, he is constantly reminding us that under the veneer of technological progress there remains, always, the beast within. This new translation captures Zola's fast-paced yet deliberately dispassionate style, while the introduction and detailed notes place the novel in its social, historical, and literary context.
