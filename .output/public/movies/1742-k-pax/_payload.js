Failure to meet this demand will result in the immediate extinction of the human race. Dr. B is amazed to discover that U.S. Government officials, including the President, have been expecting such visitors (who, though not corporeal, behave like a colony of ants), and are fully prepared to acquiesce to these demands. The problem is that the rest of the world must be convinced that the Bullocks are capable of, and willing to, eliminate human beings from the face of the Earth. Sometimes funny, always sympathetic, Dr. Brewer has a number of encounters with the Bullocks, in which he experiences undreamed of travels around the galaxy, and to his own past and beyond. For their part, the aliens willingly demonstrate their ability to remove Homo sapiens from this world. Will the clues found on the mysterious cone-shaped device be deciphered in time to save mankind from extinction?

In fact, the EARTH could truly become a paradise if the human inhabitants stopped trying their very best to \"multiply and subdue\" it. Their cancerous population growth, mindless consumption of its natural resources, and catastrophic elevation of themselves to superiority over all the other species who co-habit their PLANET have corrupted it for everyone, including themselves. Given their evolutionary history, however, perhaps the PLANET was doomed from the beginning. In any case, their self-centeredness has outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any. The \"idea\" that they are entitled to everything they can get their hands on is reinforced daily by their governments, their laws, their parents, their schools, their entertainment media, their religions. If they are to survive the next century, their juvenile egos will have to mature and learn to rely on values other than family, country, and gods to give their lives meaning. Countless humans have said to me, \"It's more complicated than that!\" But to a child, everything is complicated. Apparently nothing short of genetic manipulation will fix the defect, and even that is [fraught] with difficulties--who is going to decide which genes to manipulate? As B-TIK moves inexorably toward catastrophe, there will be more and more sapiens who will slowly awaken and wonder what went wrong. Unfortunately, it is almost too late to reverse the damage, even though a simple treatment of all their social and environmental illnesses--the elimination of capital, nations, religions, and parental indoctrination--is readily available. Yet, with only a quarter of a century left to initiate the necessary changes, the majority of them continue to go on with their robotic ways as if there will be no tomorrow. Ironic, no? Without these adjustments the prognosis is not good, and the sapiens will not survive another century. If they manage to evolve before they self-destruct, however, they could become admirable citizens of the UNIVERSE, and certainly some of the more interesting ones. But they still have a long way to go. Even after a thousand centuries of experience, they are yet children.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wLlDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2007-06-01",publisher:d,subtitle:"A PLAY, SCREENPLAY, AND A REPORT"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309535300}}("movie","Gene Brewer",null,"Xlibris Corporation","series",1,""))
