Then a relief for the survivors of Blitzkrieg and ration cards, it is now a devilishly entertaining portrayal of the Battle of the Sexes. This romantic farce, published here for the first time, is set on the Italian front in World War II, where two women war correspondents—smart, sexy, and famous for scooping their male competitors—struggle to balance their professional lives with their love lives. The American literary tradition is rife with stories of “men without women,” but in Love Goes to Press Gellhorn and Cowles have created a world of “women without men.” The plot focuses on a pair of daring, quick-witted female buddies in bold pursuit of accomplishment and adventure while narrowly eluding the entanglements of marriage and domesticity. In her six-decade career as a war correspondent, Martha Gellhorn has covered the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and wars in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Central America. (In 1990, at the age of 81, she interrupted a snorkeling trip to Belize to witness the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Panama; her report appeared in Granta.) Gellhorn has published fifteen books, including eight novels, short fiction, and two collections of journalistic articles.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9FAvFy_v7KsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Martha Gellhorn"],firstBook:true,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"U of Nebraska Press",subtitle:"A Comedy in Three Acts"}},{id:9176,attributes:{title:"The Great Swindle",description:"First published in 1960, acclaimed American journalist and biographer Virginia Cowles provides rich background information on 18th century English politics and economic theories, as well as the story of a national speculation that became a national swindle. It is a “serious and scholarly study specifically concentrated on the financial swindle in all its ramifications, rather than on a portrait of the times.” Here, in minute detail, Cowles charts both the Mississippi Bubble in France and the South Sea Bubble in England, as speculators and manipulators sold the public from the royal house down on a new way to absorb the gigantic national debts. That the promised dividends were to come out of non-existent resources and funds—backed by the presumed integrity of those who launched the scheme—was branded by Robert Walpole as “evil of the first magnitude.” Here was the initial “stock market swindle” in history, which spread to the launching of lesser swindles and highlighted the depravity of the age. A fascinating historical read.

Its glittering Tsars and Tsarinas were autocratic despots, who between them embraced all the vices (and too few of the virtues) of absolute rulers. Their name has become a byword for excess, avarice and cruelty, they have aroused intrigue and horror in equal measure. Virginia Cowles offers a portrait gallery of the outstanding members of this incredible family - from Alexis (a Tartar in his wrath) and Peter the Great (a terrifying giant) to the nymphomaniac Catherine and the doomed Nicholas II, last of the Tsars. Their domination of Russia was brought to an end in March 1917, as a result of the February Revolution. Of the 65 family members, 18 were killed by the Bolsheviks and the remaining 47 were exiled abroad. Delving behind the mass of obscure and unfamiliar historical detail, she reveals the characters and personal ties behind these strange, and often daunting, figures. She looks beyond what is written about them in the history books and explores how their family lives and secrets affected the entirety of Russia and its many citizens. 'Recounted at great speed, and with splendid life, vigour and readability' - Antonia Fraser, Evening Standard Virginia Spencer Cowles OBE was a noted American journalist, biographer, and travel writer. During her long career, Cowles went from covering fashion, to covering the Spanish Civil War, the turbulent period in Europe leading up to World War II, and the entire war. After the war, she published a number of critically acclaimed biographies of historical figures. Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher.
