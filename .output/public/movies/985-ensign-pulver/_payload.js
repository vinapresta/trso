The title character, a Lieutenant Junior Grade naval officer, defends his crew against the petty tyranny of the ship’s commanding officer during World War II. Nearly all action takes place on a backwater cargo ship, the USS Reluctant, that sails, as written in the play, “from apathy to tedium with occasional side trips to monotony and ennui.” This irreverent, often hilarious story about the crew of the Reluctant has enjoyed wide and enduring popularity. Heggen based his novel on his experiences aboard the USS Virgo in the South Pacific during World War II, and began as a collection of short stories. It was subsequently adapted as a play, a feature film, a television series, and a television movie. The film version with Henry Fonda, James Cagney and Jack Lemmon is one of the most well-known movies of WWII.-Print ed. “This book is vivid, unimpeachable narrative, with no holds barred. But elders with a distaste for the frankness of the sea and profanity should keep out.”—ATLANTIC MONTHLY “The remarkable thing is that such an honest, behind-the-scenes portrayal of the Navy as it usually is—in dungarees rather than dress blues—has never been attempted.”—BOOK WEEK “Mr. Heggen has written a little classic. It invites reading aloud; it stirs vivid memories.”—THE NEW YORK TIMES","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dtNvCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2015-11-06","Pickle Partners Publishing"))
