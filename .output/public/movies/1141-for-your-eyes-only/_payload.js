The girl was dressed in ragged coat and trousers. The beauty of her face was wild and animal, with a wide, sensuous mouth, high cheekbones and silvery gray, disdainful eyes. There was the blood of scratches on her forearms and down one cheek. She looked like a dangerous customer who knew wild country and forests and was not afraid of them. Bond thought she was wonderful.

Through an examination of Fleming's Jamaica-set novels Live and Let Die, Dr. No, and The Man with the Golden Gun, as well as the later film adaptations of these novels, Ian Kinane reveals Fleming's deep ambivalence to British decolonisation and to wider Anglo-Caribbean relations. Offered here is a crucial insight into the public imagination during the birth of modern British multiculturalism that encompasses broader links between Fleming's writings on race and the representation of early British-Jamaican cultural relations. By exploring the effects of racial representation in these popular works, Kinane connects the novels to more contemporary concerns regarding migration and the ways in which the misrepresentation of cultures, races, and peoples has led to fraught and contentious global geo-political relations as figured in the fictional icon, James Bond.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=udEhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Ian Kinane"],firstBook:d,published:"2021-04-08",publisher:"Bloomsbury Publishing",subtitle:e}},{id:6439,attributes:{title:j,description:"An anthology of short fiction chronicling the exploits and adventures of the British agent includes the tales that served as the inspiration for such films as \"Octopussy,\" \"The Living Daylights,\" \"For Your Eyes Only,\" and the \"Quantum of Solace.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WLIrAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:k,publisher:"Penguin Group USA",subtitle:"007, the Complete James Bond Short Stories"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069553602}}("movie","series","Ian Fleming",null,"",1,"For Your Eyes Only","2017-07-11","Pickle Partners Publishing","Quantum of Solace","2008-01-01"))
