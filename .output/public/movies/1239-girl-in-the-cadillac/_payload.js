She’s didn’t mind the pain, but hated the look in his eye and his lingering hand. By the time she’s fifteen, this young spitfire can’t take any more of his unwanted groping. With seventy-four bucks in her pocket, she packs her things and buys the bus ticket that will change her life. She meets Rick at the bus stop—a handsome young thug who’s a few days removed from his last bath. He’s charming and sympathetic, so she buys him a ticket and, on the ride to Baltimore, tells him that she’s going to find her real father. But wouldn’t it be better, Rick suggests, to greet Daddy in style? Of course, a mink coat would cost a little money, but Rick knows just where to get it. His plan is daring, foolish, and highly dangerous. What teenage runaway could resist?","James M. Cain","2013-01-15"))
