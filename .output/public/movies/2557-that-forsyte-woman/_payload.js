The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2021-08-27",publisher:"FilRougeViceversa",subtitle:a}},{id:12297,attributes:{title:e,description:"John Galsworthy's (1867-1933) classic, The Forsyte Saga is a series of three novels and two interludes published between 1906 and 1921, chronicling the leading members of an upper-middle-class British family only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tvAfbHa3nDYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2010-12-31",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12298,attributes:{title:e,description:"The Forsyte Saga comprises of The Man of Property, In Chancery and To Let, produced in a single volume.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xsONz2M-r2IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2002-01-01",publisher:"Wordsworth Editions",subtitle:a}},{id:12299,attributes:{title:"The Novels, Tales and Plays of John Galsworthy: The Forsyte saga",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=NuVGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"1926-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12300,attributes:{title:e,description:"In this second part of John Galworthy's trilogy of love, power, money and family feuding, a new generation has arrived to divide the Forsyte clan with society scandals and conflicting passions",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hm5hvzzKET8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2001-09-27",publisher:"Penguin UK",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531259303}}("","movie","John Galsworthy","series","The Forsyte Saga",null,1))
