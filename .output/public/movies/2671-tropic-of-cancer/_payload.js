Miller, personnel manager of the Cosmodemonic Telegraph Co., spends his days hiring and firing a succession of wasters, maniacs, perverts, ex-cons, idiots and whores - while also writing the most important work of literature ever published and enjoying increasingly outrageous erotic exploits. Banned for thirty years, this riotous companion piece to Tropic of Cancer is a frank portrait of the Brooklyn of Miller's youth - its skyscrapers and sewers, its lusts and dejection - and a savage attack on America. 'American Literature begins and ends with the meaning of what Miller has done.' Lawrence Durrell 'His writing is flamboyant, torrential, chaotic, treacherous, and dangerous.'

Tropic [of Cancer] turns the corner into a new life which has regained its bowels.\" Henry Miller, realizing that in Lawrence Durrell he had hooked his ideal reader, responded: \"You're the first Britisher who's written me an intelligent letter about the book.\" Thus began a correspondence that ended only with Miller's death in 1980 - nearly 1,000,000 words later. The Durrell-Miller Letters, 1935-80 contains an extensive and representative selection of the total correspondence. Almost half of the present volume has never been published before, including some recently recovered \"lost\" letters; in addition, many passages expurgated from letters published in 1963 have been restored. Editor Ian S. MacNiven of the State University of New York, Maritime College, is quite right to regard the Durrell-Miller correspondence as a dual biography of the creative lives of two of this century'sgreat literary iconoclasts, a biography \"At once as serious as Schopenhauer and as winning as wine.\" \"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FFBeeREKoDwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Lawrence Durrell",b],firstBook:c,published:"1998-09-19",publisher:"New Directions Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:12780,attributes:{title:"Henry Miller's Book of Friends",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VbuwAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Trilogy"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940903564}}("","Henry Miller",null,"Tropic of Cancer","1961-01-01"))
