Tanner now manages a tea plantation and wants to accompany Black on the hunt in order to impress his young son, Michael. Black still loves Chris, with whom he had had a brief affair when visiting her to tell her about her husband's imprisonment, and Tanner senses this. Although none of the two men openly admit it they compete against each other for Chris' love.

The United States copyright system allows a film to fall into the public domain if a renewal is not filed in the twenty-eighth year after its release. Such public domain films may be used by anyone for free, but finding out which films are or are not still under copyright can be expensive and tedious. This guide alleviates that expense and drudgery by including all motion pictures registered for copyright in the 1950s, as well as 500 that were received after 1959. The book also includes an overview of the copyright system and sample certificates. All renewals of copyrights are noted, allowing readers to clearly see which items are or are not in the public domain.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GaUqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Pierce"],firstBook:c,published:"1989-01-01",publisher:"McFarland Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:7420,attributes:{title:"British Sound Films",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=68szAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:c,published:"1985-01-01",publisher:"Barnes & Noble Imports",subtitle:"The Studio Years 1928-1959"}},{id:7421,attributes:{title:"Quinlan's Illustrated Directory of Film Stars",description:"Including over 1800 entries, this guide provides a short biography for each star, with a complete filmography of all film, television, voice-overs and guest appearances.
