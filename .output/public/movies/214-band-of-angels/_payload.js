During the fifteen-year period spanned by this correspondence, he completed Brother to Dragons; Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South; and Who Speaks for the Negro? As these titles suggest, these years were marked by Warren's immersion in American history and his maturing interest in race relations. They also saw his return to lyric poetry, after a ten-year hiatus, with the publication of the Pulitzer Prize--winning collection Promises. Along with seeing the completion of some of his most successful work, this period was a time of momentous change in Warren's life, including his move to Yale University; his marriage to his second wife, Eleanor; and the birth of his two children. As a chronicle of Warren's thoughts on his family, his work, his friends, the state of literary studies, and the culture at large, these letters are invaluable.Unlike many writers, Warren rarely drafted his correspondence with future readers and scholars in mind; he typically saved his prepared statements about the human condition and the state of the world for his poetry, fiction, and social commentary. His letters offer a candid and personal glimpse of Warren's relationships as well as his personal views on literature, politics, and social trends. Their recipients include Ralph Ellison, Allen Tate, Saul Bellow, Robert Lowell, Eudora Welty, and Louis Rubin, as well as Warren's editors, reviewers, collaborators, and other friends.Providing an unusually vivid and personal account of Warren's rich and fully realized life, these missives are equally revealing of his thoughts on the state of contemporary American culture during this dynamic time in American history.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VJ3QYecYpjgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"2008-05-01",publisher:h,subtitle:"New Beginnings and New Directions, 1953-1968"}},{id:2599,attributes:{title:"The People We Meet in Stories",description:"Novels bring us into fictional worlds where we encounter the lives, struggles, and dreams of characters who speak to the underlying pulse of society and social change. In this book, post–World War II America comes alive again as literary critic Robert McParland tilts the rearview mirror to see the characters that captured the imaginations of millions of readers in the most popular and influential novels of the 1950s. This literary era introduced us to Holden Caulfield, Augie March, Lolita, and other antiheroes. Together with popular culture heroes such as Perry Mason and James Bond, they entertained thousands of readers while revealing the underlying currents of ambition, desire, and concern that were central to the American Dream. Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man and James Baldwin’s Go Tell It on the Mountain and Giovanni’sRoom explored racial issues and matters of identity that reverberate still today. The works of Jack Kerouac, the Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso, and the clever and creative William S. Burroughs and his Naked Lunch challenged conventional perspectives. The People We Meet in Stories will appeal to readers discovering these works for the first time and to those whose tattered paperbacks reveal a long relationship with these key works in American literary history.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HkL2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Robert McParland"],firstBook:c,published:"2020-10-20",publisher:"Rowman & Littlefield Publishers",subtitle:"Literary Characters That Defined the 1950s"}},{id:2600,attributes:{title:"Robert Penn Warren's Modernist Spirituality",description:"As a man who disclaimed any kind of religious orthodoxy, Robert Penn Warren nonetheless found in Christianity \"the deepest and widest metaphor for life.\" The significance he drew from it was one he expressed strictly in humanistic and natural terms: spiritual renewal and redemption were possible through engagement with literature and participation in the world. In Robert Penn Warren's Modernist Spirituality, Robert Koppelman explores the spiritual or religious dimension to Warren's work in light of his admitted agnosticism. Beginning with an overview of Warren's career as a Fugitive at Vanderbilt and then, later, as a formidable New Critic, Koppelman argues that Warren's regard for the spiritual aesthetic of both literary language and form can be traced to his early study of poetic metaphor. To illustrate Warren's mature vision, Koppelman centers his study on two novels and two poetry collections: All the King's Men, A Place to Come To, Promises: Poems 1954-1956, and Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978. He also examines the critical studies that concentrate on Warren's vision of time, history, and spiritual fulfillment, as well as those essays by Warren that complement his poems and novels in such a way as to elicit the reader's participation in the redemption of their narrators. Robert Penn Warren's Modernist Spirituality renews Warren's commitment to experiencing both literature and life as opportunities to participate in a realm of beauty and vision that is still open to contemporary readers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ENMgf4hjCvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Robert Steven Koppelman"],firstBook:c,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"University of Missouri Press",subtitle:g}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069437767}}("movie","series",null,"Band of Angels","Robert Penn Warren",1,"","LSU Press"))
