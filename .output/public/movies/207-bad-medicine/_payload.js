To a LAPD Detective, it looks like Professor Ken Chestnut's teaching assistant, Jason Duffy, is guilty. When the TA is arrested, Chestnut hires a lawyer and learns that the only thing that will save the grad student from death row is for the missing children to return home alive and well. Chestnut sets out to find the youths and the cooling trail of evidence leads him to a face-off with his professional nemesis, Scott Kenyatta, an unscrupulous Oxford Professor and African Prince who has taken the children to the Congo. Chestnut finds the youths living among a diminutive \"hunter and gathering\" clan called the Efe. He fully expected his mission on the African Continent to be a difficult one. But what he didn't anticipate was becoming a key component of Kenyatta's bizarre sociological research project that's using the torrid unforgiving Ituri Rain Forest as its laboratory. This odyssey turns out to be a contemporary \"Roots\" for the foursome. When they return to civilization, they bring back fresh perspectives of where they came from, who they are and what they might become…",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=gbsi6N5TW2cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Steve Duncan"],firstBook:d,published:"2000-09-01",publisher:"iUniverse",subtitle:a}},{id:2566,attributes:{title:"Philadelphia Jewish Life, 1940-2000",description:"In a city with a long history of high social barriers and forbidding aristocratic preserves, Philadelphia Jews, in the last half of the twentieth century, became a force to reckon with in the cultural, political and economic life of the region. From the poor neighborhoods of original immigrant settlement, in South and West Philadelphia, Jews have made, as Murray Friedman recounts, the move from \"outsiders\" to \"insiders\" in Philadelphia life. Essays by a diverse range of contributors tell the story of this transformation in many spheres of life, both in and out of the Jewish community: from sports, politics, political alliances with other minority groups, to the significant debate between Zionists and anti-Zionists during and immediately after the war.In this new edition, Friedman takes the history of Philadelphia Jewish life to the close of the twentieth century, and looks back on how Jews have shaped-and have been shaped by-Philadelphia and its long immigrant history. Author note: Murray Friedman is Middle-Atlantic Regional Director of the American Jewish Committee and Director of the Myer and Rosaline Feinstein Center for American Jewish History at Temple University. He is the author or editor of numerous books, including, most recently (with Albert D.

In the 1940s and much of the 1950s, hardly a month went by without at least one blatantly pro–air power article appearing in general interest magazines. Public fascination with flight helped create and sustain exaggerated expectations for air power in the minds of both its official proponents and the American public. Articles in the Saturday Evening Post, Reader's Digest, and Life trumpeted the secure future assured by American air superiority. Military figures like Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold and Curtis E. LeMay, radio-television personalities such as Arthur Godfrey, cartoon figures like Steve Canyon, and actors like Jimmy Stewart played key roles in the unfolding campaign. Movies like Twelve O'Clock High!, The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, and A Gathering of Eagles projected onto the public imagination vivid images confirming what was coming to be the accepted wisdom: that America's safety against the Soviet threat could best be guaranteed by air power, coupled with nuclear capability. But as the Cold War continued and the specter of the mushroom cloud grew more prominent in American minds, another, more sinister interpretation began to take hold. Call chronicles the shift away from the heroic, patriotic posture of the years just after World War II, toward the threatening, even bizarre imagery of books and movies like Catch-22, On the Beach, and Dr. Strangelove. Call's careful analysis goes beyond the public relations campaigns to probe the intellectual climate that shaped them and gave them power. Selling Air Power adds a critical layer of understanding to studies in military and aviation history, as well as American popular culture.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=x1BYWGP93xAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Steve Call"],firstBook:d,published:"2009-03-01",publisher:"Texas A&M University Press",subtitle:"Military Aviation and American Popular Culture after World War II"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069438010}}("","movie","series",null,1))
