The new Commander, Ian Moor - young, brilliant and determined - knows that the only thing that will pull it together again is the challenge of another vital mission. The Germans are developing a new anti-aircraft rocket, code name Rhine Maiden, which poses the most deadly threat so far to the Allies' invasion plans. So the top brass decide that 633 Squadron should first flatten the rocket factory on a bombing run, and then make a daring strike on an underground target buried deep in a Bavarian valley - in broad daylight...",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DGJhHQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:true,published:"2004-07-01",publisher:"Weidenfeld & Nicolson",subtitle:"Operation Rhine Maiden"}},{id:1864,attributes:{title:"Operation Titan",description:"COUNTDOWN TO D-DAY The immense Allied landing on the coast of France signals invasion to the enemy, and the mighty German panzer divisions begin a furious race northward to the beaches of Normandy.

They were top pilots who flew with the recklessness of a passionate hatred for the enemy. But although they were fighting machines, they were also men. There was the Wing Commander, tough, cynical, careless of his life but not of his crews; Gillibrand, the big, brash flier who never knew when to stop; Bergman, the Norwegian resistance fighter whose bravery was remarkable even when acts of courage were an everyday event. The planes roared down the runway on that cold spring morning. And the men who had lived together, trained together, played together, were off on a mission that could change the course of the war. \"YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO ABORT MISSION\" The desperate message crackled over the R\u002FT. A dangerous mission had become suicidal. But as their planes screamed over the black fjords of Norway, the men of 633 Squadron refused to turn back. Caught between attacking German aircraft and the grim mountain walls, they plunged straight on into a howling valley of death.
