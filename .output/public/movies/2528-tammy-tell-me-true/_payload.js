If you could look at our world with fresh eyes, wouldn’t it give you a whole new perspective on life and help you to rediscover its true values? Well, Tammy, the lovable young girl you’ll meet in these pages, does just that. Before things began to happen, you see, Tammy had lived all her seventeen years on a Mississippi shantyboat. It was a very simple, quiet, isolated life she had had with her grandparents. But then, after Pete Brent was rescued from the river, things changed, and Tammy found herself at Brenton Hall, where there were some marvelous contrivances and concoctions and also some curious ideas and customs and ways of speaking. Life wasn’t so simple for Tammy any more. In fact, Pete’s mother, Professor Brent, Pete himself, the lovely Barbara, Aunt Renie, and Ernie (especially Ernie) posed many problems. But Tammy, a most unusual and most enduring creature, came through with flying colours. And her story—a warm, lively, engaging story—is the kind that makes you laugh aloud, perhaps stirs a tear or two as well, and along with the entertainment, brings inspiration, a fresh perspective through which you may find strength and a new peace of mind.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FcZQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2018-03-12",publisher:i,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:12166,attributes:{title:"But the Morning Will Come",description:"Originally published in 1949, this book tells the story of a Southern white girl and her reaction when she discovers that her unborn child will inherit Negro blood. Bentley Carr grew up without knowing she was a very pretty girl. Daughter of a seamstress in a Mississippi town, she felt overwhelmed when she became the bride of Philip Churston of Cedar Bluff plantation. She was happy when she knew she was to bear him a child. Happy—until she discovered why the whisper ran about the Churstons: a strain of Negro blood in the family! That was why Philip was cold to the coming heir; why there were never any visitors at Cedar Bluff. Her dilemma faced her starkly: must she, too, learn to live a lie? “Grace in the writing, warm appreciation of the emotional involvements, and of the relationship between background and action....”—W.
