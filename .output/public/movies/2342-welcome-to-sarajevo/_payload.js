Set in the Middle East, the United States of America and the rough snowbound terrain of England's Lake District, Michael Nicholson's powerful new novel takes place over just four days. But they are four dangerous days in which the balance of world power wavers unsteadily as opposing factions battle for control of Riyadh and Saudi Arabia's oilwells, Whitehall wonders what to do, and an abrasive new US President strives to retain control over the oil his country depends on.",thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2014-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:11388,attributes:{title:"Global Journalism",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UalxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Vera Slavtcheva-Petkova"],firstBook:c,published:"2019-01-01",publisher:"Macmillan International Higher Education",subtitle:"An Introduction"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940926911}}("","Michael Nicholson",null,"Welcome to Sarajevo","Natasha's Story"))
