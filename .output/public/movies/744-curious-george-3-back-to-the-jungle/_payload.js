Graham was a long-time friend and neighbor of Hans and Margret Rey. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together. The character for whom the author-illustrator team became best known, Curious George, arrived as one of many monkey children in Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, Hans’s first book for children. Encouraged by their publisher and children throughout the world, the Reys continued with more books about Curious George. In the meantime, the Reys published a number of books showcasing their creative talents and their rare, immediate connection with childhood. These books feature characters, all with their own personalities, and a few with resemblances to George.
