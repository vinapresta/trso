He runs off to hide out and joins a French trader and his women who are searching for the source of a native necklace made of platinum. On their trip they come across German troops who are enslaving natives and are chased by the British troops. They encounter hostile natives, leopards, and various groups of cheetahs and lions and endure a stampede, quicksand, crossing deserts and mountains. Horn is obviously interested in the Frenchman's women and saves her life a couple times and they eventually become involved. They continue on to the source of the platinum and an encounter with the Germans and finally the British troops.
