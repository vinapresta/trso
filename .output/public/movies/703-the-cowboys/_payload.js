A heartless savage, the Ronin, or \"wandering samurai,\" slashes his way up from the gutter to wealth, honor and status. In spite of his crime sand bloodthirsty cruelty, he bears the strange mark of destiny that the wise see and respect, even as he destroys them. The tale which is told with humor and irony, ranges from the pleasantly colloquial to the brutally satiric, yet never relents in the Ronin's ruthless search for the truth. The storyteller hides nothing and speaks bluntly, yet this jewel-like tale shimmers with tantalizing riddles that will haunt the reader just as they haunted the Ronin. Sure to shock, confound and ultimately inspire readers, The Ronin is loosely based on an ancient legend told to the author by the Zen Master Nyogen Senzaki.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yDHHwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:d,published:"2007-12-15",publisher:"Tuttle Publishing",subtitle:b}},{id:4614,attributes:{title:"The Psychology of the Western",description:"Western films are often considered sprawling reflections of the American spirit.
