As Robert Kaplan writes in his Introduction, “[Taras Bulba] has a Kiplingesque gusto . . . that makes it a pleasure to read, but central to its theme is an unredemptive, darkly evil violence that is far beyond anything that Kipling ever touched on. We need more works like Taras Bulba to better understand the emotional wellsprings of the threat we face today in places like the Middle East and Central Asia.” And the critic John Cournos has noted, “A clue to all Russian realism may be found in a Russian critic’s observation about Gogol: ‘Seldom has nature created a man so romantic in bent, yet so masterly in portraying all that is unromantic in life.’ But this statement does not cover the whole ground, for it is easy to see in almost all of Gogol’s work his ‘free Cossack soul’ trying to break through the shell of sordid today like some ancient demon, essentially Dionysian. So that his works, true though they are to our life, are at once a reproach, a protest, and a challenge, ever calling for joy, ancient joy, that is no more with us. And they have all the joy and sadness of the Ukrainian songs he loved so much.”",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IyHJQ__j5isC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:"2003-04-01",publisher:"Modern Library",subtitle:b}},{id:12175,attributes:{title:f,description:"Some of the most powerful and dramatic writing of one of the men who opened the minds of the Russian people by showing them as others saw them.

Fast flowing, deep and expressive without wasting time on sublimities, Gogol took us into a journey of Cossack wars that introduces us to their values, way of life, and colorful traditions. Unfortunately, Taras Bulba's warpath causes the loss of his favorite son who chose to rescue the Polish woman she loved, whose city was under siege by the troops his father was leading.

Em suas obras, o escritor trouxe à tona uma visão satírica da realidade russa na primeira metade do século XIX. Taras Bulba é uma das obras de destaque Nikolai Gogol. Trata-se de um romance histórico que narra a história de um velho cossaco ucraniano, Taras Bulba, e os seus dois filhos, Andríi e Ostap. Os filhos do Taras estudam na Universidade Nacional Academia Kyiv – Mohyla, e voltam para casa de férias. Daí os três homens viajam para a Sich de Zaporizhia, situada na Ucrânia, na ilha de Khortytsia, para se juntar aos outros cossacos na guerra contra a Polônia. A história do Taras Bulba é repleta de personagens plenamente reais no ambiente em que são retratados, o que é bastante usual nas obras do Gogol. A antológica obra Taras Bulba serviu de inspiração para uma ópera ucraniana e foi vertida para as telas de cinema inúmeras vezes. O notório escritor americano Ernest Hemingway se referiu a ela como sendo \"Um dos 10 livros mais importantes de todos os tempos.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=6XU-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"2021-08-19",publisher:"LeBooks Editora ",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069433866}}("movie","","series","Nikolai Gogol",null,"Taras Bulba",1))
