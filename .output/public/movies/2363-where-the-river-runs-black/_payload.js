There is a place in Alabama, a region that stretches across its lower middle from Georgia to Mississippi. It is a place steeped in history—a place where a people were enslaved, a nation was broken, and a new dream of freedom was born. It is a place where the past is always near at hand. And sometimes, that past takes a moment to whisper in your ear. They call this place the Black Belt. From the Cato-Thorn House in Barbour County to the Snow Hill Institute in Wilcox County, Alabama’s Black Belt has a great number of restless spirits that still haunt it. Join paranormal researcher David Higdon and Bram Stoker Award nominee Brett Talley as they uncover the ghosts and hauntings of one of Alabama’s most historic areas.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HKt2CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Higdon","Brett Talley"],firstBook:b,published:"2013-08-20",publisher:"Arcadia Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:11486,attributes:{title:"Habitat, Biota, and Sediment Characteristics at Selected Stations in the Lower Illinois River Basin, Illinois, 1996-98",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nODvKQwU-rMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Debbie L.

This is the first time that such extensive coverage has ever been attempted, and the volumes incorporate the very latest information and detailed discussion of the morphology, distribution, biology and evolution (including reference to fossil and molecular data) of Africa's mammals. With 1,160 species and 16 orders, Africa has the greatest diversity and abundance of mammals in the world. The reasons for this and the mechanisms behind their evolution are given special attention in the series. Each volume follows the same format, with detailed profiles of every species and higher taxa. The series includes some 660 colour illustrations by Jonathan Kingdon and his many drawings highlight details of morphology and behaviour of the species concerned. Diagrams, schematic details and line drawings of skulls and jaws are by Jonathan Kingdon and Meredith Happold. Every species also includes a detailed distribution map. Extensive references alert readers to more detailed information.
