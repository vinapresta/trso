This complicates matters, as does a fire on board, as does the discovery that the champaigne cargo is really water. They arrive at an uncharted island ruled by Alan Napier, a sophisticated British gentleman who is several cards short of playing with a full deck. Crazy as a bedbug. More complications arise, such as snake pits and acid-assassination attempts. Napier likes to keep his island tidy...something Sam Newfield was unable to do with this film as the director.

Published the year of Stevenson's death from tuberculosis, the last of three collaborations between the legendary Scottish storyteller and his stepson is a story of adventure, friendship, and greed. Although less popular than other titles in Stevenson's body of work, the novel has been recognized for its pointed critique of British and American imperialism in the South Pacific. Tossed by the waves of fate, three beggars frequent the ports of Tahiti in search of money and food for survival. When a merchant schooner devastated by smallpox docks at Papeete in need of new officers, the only men willing to take the job are Davis, Herrick, and Huish. A former sea captain, Davis takes charge of the vessel filled with crates of champagne, but soon the men find their cargo too tempting to leave untested. As the crew descends into drunkenness, Huish--the only beggar born into poverty, the only one among them who understands the value of a job--takes control of the schooner. As they near their final destination, as the men begin to worry about the missing cargo and lack of food, a plot to overthrow the officers takes form. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne's The Ebb-Tide is a classic work of adventure fiction reimagined for modern readers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ecV_zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,"Lloyd Osbourne"],firstBook:true,published:"2021-06-21",publisher:"Mint Editions",subtitle:a}},{id:2036,attributes:{title:"The Ebb-Tide by Robert Louis Stevenson - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)",description:"This eBook features the unabridged text of ‘The Ebb-Tide’ from the bestselling edition of ‘The Complete Works of Robert Louis Stevenson’.

Their desperate venture inspires them to a further idea: they will steal the schooner and its cargo of champagne, sell them, and live a plentiful life. The thought is intoxicating... and so is the cargo, which they sample. Inattention nearly brings them to grief in a sudden storm. This sobering experience is followed by another - apparently the dead officers had a similar ambition! - and their dreams of riches vanish. Then, nearly out of provisions and deep in the heart of the Pacific where the chart shows no land - they happen on a small isle only hinted at in the records and never mapped. Saved! But what is this? The island hides a pearl fishery? In the ebb-tide of fortune, what new villainy will the three attempt? (Summary by Mark F.
