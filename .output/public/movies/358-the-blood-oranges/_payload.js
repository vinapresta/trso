That anything less than sexual multiplicity . . . is naive? That our sexual selves are merely idylers in a vast wood?\" Thus the central theme of John Hawkes's widely acclaimed novel The Blood Oranges is boldly asserted by its narrator, Cyril, the archetypal multisexualist. Likening himself to a white bull on Love's tapestry, he pursues his romantic vision in a primitive Mediterranean landscape. There two couples—Cyril and Fiona, Hugh and Catherine—mingle their loves in an \"lllyria\" that brings to mind the equally timeless countryside of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ANL5MXikzYsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1972-04-17"))
