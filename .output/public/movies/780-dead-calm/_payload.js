No one is onboard, but the hold is stuffed with cash, the coffeepot is still warm, and a hint of perfume hangs in the air. The passengers have vanished, but the ship’s log tells a chilling story of the madness peculiar to the search for sunken riches. The journal was written by salvage diver Bill Manning, who was out of money and out of luck when he met a statuesque Swede named Shannon. She and her husband hire him to sail them to the Yucatan coast, to find a plane that went down carrying untold wealth. But a pair of gangsters is pursuing them, hoping for a crack at the treasure as well. For the sake of Shannon’s beauty Manning will chase this fortune, knowing it will take him to the height of riches, or to the bottom of the Caribbean Sea.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dNi_2HeDOPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:g,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:a}},{id:4968,attributes:{title:"Talk of the Town",description:"Stranded in a small town, a stranger falls for a suspected murderess Bored, divorced, and unemployed, Chatham is on his way to the Gulf of Mexico when he passes through a small town by the river. It’s a miserable little burg—four stoplights and not much else—and he’s almost escaped it when a drunk’s car darts out in front of him, causing a nasty fender-bender. The thought of three days waiting for his clunker to get fixed is a grim one, but though he doesn’t know it, there won’t be a dull minute. Chatham finds hospitality in the lovely form of Mrs. Langton, motel owner and local pariah. Seven months ago her husband was murdered, and though the police could find no evidence to support the theory, everyone in town is convinced she killed him. Now a string of anonymous threats have left her close to a nervous breakdown, and the violence is about to become real. In a town this small there’s no room for secrets, but plenty of places to bury a corpse.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=laaz9uaOtq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:g,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531322846}}("","movie","Charles Williams","series","2012-09-18","Open Road Media",null,"Dead Calm",1,"Two honeymooners take a stranger onto their yacht—with terrifying consequences—in this “superb” psychological thriller (The New York Times). Rae and Ingram are nineteen days out of the Panama Canal, sailing slowly across the wide, flat Pacific on the Saracen, when they find Hughie Warriner in his dinghy. He was on a pleasure cruise in his yacht, the Orpheus, he says, when food poisoning killed his passengers and his ship began to sink. After an alleged ten days of desperately fighting to stay afloat he spied the Saracen, and rowed to his salvation. Finding the stranded yacht, against Warriner’s wishes, Ingram boards the stranded Orpheus. There he finds Warriner’s passengers—very much alive, and hungry for revenge against the man who attacked them and left them to drown. Ingram tries to get back to his ship, but is too late. Warriner escapes with his yacht, taking Rae hostage, and Ingram hasno means to save them but tattered sails, a sinking ship, and rage that burns hotter than the merciless Pacific sun.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nkzK39ZPsXwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
