It also includes Stoker's typewritten research notes and thoroughly analyzes all of the materials, which range from Stoker's thoughts on the novel's characters and settings to a nine-page calendar of events that includes most of the now-familiar story. Ample annotations guide readers through the construction of the novel and the changes that were made to its structure, plot, setting and characters.
