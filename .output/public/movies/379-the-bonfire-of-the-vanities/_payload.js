Brilliant high comedy.” (The New Republic) Sherman McCoy, the central figure of Tom Wolfe's first novel, is a young investment banker with a fourteen-room apartment in Manhattan. When he is involved in a freak accident in the Bronx, prosecutors, politicians, the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers high and low close in on him, licking their chops and giving us a gargantuan helping of the human comedy, of New York in the 1980s, a city boiling over with racial and ethnic hostilities and burning with the itch to Grab It Now. Wolfe's novel is a big, panoramic story of the metropolis that reinforces the author's reputation as the foremost chronicler of the way we live in America.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=u0W4zg1OzBEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2002-02-21","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","A Novel","1988-01-01","The Bonfire of the vanities"))
