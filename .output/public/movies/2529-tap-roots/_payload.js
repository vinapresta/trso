He was known for his visual flair and timeless innovation, a man who meticulously preplanned the color and design of each film through a series of continuity sketches that made clear camera angles, lighting, and the actors’ positions for each scene, translating dramatic conventions of the stage to the new capabilities of film. Here is the long-awaited book on William Cameron Menzies, Hollywood’s first and greatest production designer, a job title David O. Selznick invented for Menzies’ extraordinary, all-encompassing, Academy Award–winning work on Gone With the Wind (which he effectively co-directed). It was Menzies—winner of the first-ever Academy Award for Art Direction, jointly for The Dove (1927) and Tempest (1928), and who was as well a director (fourteen pictures) and a producer (twelve pictures)—who changed the way movies were (and still are) made, in a career that spanned four decades, from the 1920s through the 1950s. His more than 120 films include Rosita (1923), Things to Come (1936), Foreign Correspondent (1940), Kings Row (1942), Mr. Lucky (1943), The Pride of the Yankees (1943), For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Address Unknown (1944), It’s a Wonderful Life (1947), Invaders from Mars (1953), and Around the World in 80 Days (1956). Now, James Curtis, acclaimed film historian and biographer, writes of Menzies’ life and work as the most influential designer in the history of film. His artistry encompassed the large, scenic drawings of Douglas Fairbanks’ The Thief of Bagdad (1924), which created a new standard for beauty on the screen and whose exotic fairy-tale sets are still regarded as pure genius. (“I saw The Thief of Bagdad when it first came out,” said Orson Welles—he was, at the time, a nine-year-old boy. “I’ll never forget it.”) Curtis writes of Menzies’ design and supervision of John Barrymore’s Beloved Rogue (1927), a film that remains a masterpiece of craft and synthesis, one of the most distinctive pictures to emerge from Hollywood’s waning days of silent films, and of his extraordinary, opulent appointments for Gone With the Wind (1939). It was Menzies who defined and solidified the role of art director as having overall control of the look of the motion picture, collaborating with producers like David O. Selznick and Samuel Goldwyn; with directors such as D. W. Griffith, Raoul Walsh, Alfred Hitchcock, Lewis Milestone, and Frank Capra. And with actors as varied as Ingrid Bergman, W. C. Fields, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, John Barrymore, Barbara Stanwyck, Ronald Reagan, Gary Cooper, Vivien Leigh, Carole Lombard, Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, and David Niven. Interviewing colleagues, actors, directors, friends, and family, and with full access to the William Cameron Menzies family collection of original artwork, correspondence, scrapbooks, and unpublished writing, Curtis brilliantly gives us the path-finding work of the movies’ most daring and dynamic production designer: his evolution as artist, art director, production designer, and director. Here is a portrait of a man in his time that makes clear how the movies were forever transformed by his startling, visionary work.

This is his best and he uses the battle for Vicksburg, the saga of the Confederate ironclad Arkansas and the Union ram Queen of the West for a story as big as the Mississippi. The epic of the Arkansas, built in the wilderness by men who hauled her iron and guns hundreds of miles by ox wagons, is one of the most amazing and little-known dramas of history. She struck terror from Illinois to New Orleans and became a ship that men whispered about; a ghost ship whose guns kept blazing although there were no men aboard her. Mr. Street gives us a galaxy of characters in this book. Most of the action revolves around three Confederate sailors; Wyeth Woodward, gunner's mate, who hates war; Simeon St. Leger Granville, a British soldier of fortune whose lust for battle is exceeded only by his lust for drink, and Vespasian Gillivray, the lovable Cajan, a descendant of the Creeks of Mr. Street's Oh, Promised Land. The fourth member of a quartet you never will forget is Dolly — fat, cold, deadly. She is a nine-inch Dahlgren gun on whose breech is engraved By Valour and Arms. There also is Gar Rivers, an inspiring Negro, an artist of sorts who fought for a slave-owning people. In these pages you will meet Laurel MacKenzie, betrothed to Wyeth, and Morna (Dabney) Alexander, who wants the young sailor just to prove to herself that marriage has not dulled her charms. Tap Roots' readers will remember her and her melancholiac husband, Keith Alexander, a Southerner who fights for the Union. Keith is here, too, contemptuous as ever of his own life and the lives of others. Then there is Sharon Weatherford, a rooming-house keeper in Natchez-Under-the-Hill. Her love for Simeon St. Leger Granville apparently is a hopeless thing, and yet she, a social and racial outcast, meets every challenge, and triumphs. The story begins with the building of the Arkansas and ends with the fall of Vicksburg, which was to the South what Hastings was to England during the Norman conquest. The Union was saved in the West, but that theater has been neglected. Few Americans realize that the Battle of Franklin was bloodier than Gettysburg, that the Arkansas created more havoc than the Merrimac, and that Vicksburg held out for more than a year. As in Tap Roots, Mr. Street warns his readers again that they will not find the Civil War of Lee and Jackson in this book. This is history as it happened, not the dry meager words of textbooks or the dulcet tones of the julep school. Scoundrels and mountebanks work and cheat in the red glare of Vicksburg's guns. But man is at his best while making war and even when human life is not as dear as rotten mule meat, there are those who prove again that there always will be honor, decency, and dignity for those willing to fight for them.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tHyiAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:g,published:d,publisher:e,subtitle:f}},{id:12171,attributes:{title:"Oh Promised Land",description:"In 1795 the rugged and dangerous Mississippi Territory is open for exploration and settlement by the rare few who have the courage and determination to survive. When pioneers Sam'l Dabney and his sister, Honoria, lose their parents in a Creek attack and must leave Georgia to begin new lives, they head for French-held Louisiana in order to find \"Lock Poka\", which in Choktaw means \"here we rest\" or \"promised land\". Sam Dabney is a man of rare strength and size and resolute spirit — a larger-than-life hero who rises by his boldness and acumen from being \"ol' man Dabney's brat\" to a man of consequence in the settling, trading, and armed protection of the land. Sam, his sister Honoria, his wife Donna, and his Choktaw companion, Tishomingo, form the core of this panoramic saga — Sam is an opportunist and is quick to take risks in order to establish himself and support his family; Donna, devoted but delicate, finds her life threatened by fever, but helps Sam guard a dangerous secret; Honoria, beautiful, unscrupulous and greedy, makes money her only standard; and Tishmingo works to develop an English alphabet for the Cherokee language and fulfills a debt of hatred. The story also teems with historical characters, Indians, renegades, politicians, pioneers, slaves and richly portrayed incidental figures as well as facts about French, Spanish, British and American interests that enhance or impede progress on every page. Oh Promised Land is the first book in a five novel saga of the unforgettable Dabney family.

Old and dying, he and Tishomingo, a prince of the Choctaws, are all who are left of the group who fled the Promised Land. After Sam's death, the Dabney family, strong, greedy, and imbued with raw courage, jeers at fate and dares the impossible. They secede from Mississippi, organize an independent republic called the Free State of Lebanon, and wage a no-quarter war against the might and millions of the Confederacy at a time when the Union seemed doomed. Some die in battle, others on the gallows, and only a few live to see the tiny spark they kindled blaze into a fire for freedom. The family is led by Sam's son, Hoab, a shouting abolitionist and religious zealot, whose secret is still carefully guarded and, if ever revealed, may rock the South. He and wife, Shellie, and their children — Cormac, red-headed Morna, in spirit much like her great-aunt, Honoria, and the twins Aven and Bruce continue Sam's legacy — the tap root that pushed through the loam and into the red clay bed of the valley and from which the Dabney legacy continues to flourish. They are joined by others — neighbor Claiborne MacIvor, who loved two Dabney women; Keith Alexander, the morose and unbelievably handsome Black Knight of Vengeance; and Reverend Kirkland, the pudgy little preacher who told a great denomination, \"I'll see you in hell before I surrender my rights. I am but a feeble ripple, but behind me comes the whirlwind.\" Tap Roots begins in 1858 and moves to a thunderous climax in 1865. The book is based on the true story of the \"free state of Jones\" in which the farmers and workmen of Jones County in Mississippi decide to succeed from both the United States and the Confederacy. In this part of the South there were few if any plantations, most people worked their own farms and held no slaves and they strongly resented being required \"to fight a rich man's war\". The majority of settlers were also of Scots-Irish decent and did not believe in slavery, so they decided to form a Republic of free men. Tap Roots was a best seller and later made into a film starring Susan Hayward.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bX2iAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
