But van Gogh was also a prodigious writer of letters—more than eight hundred of them, addressed to his parents, to friends such as Paul Gauguin and, above all, to his brother Theo. His letters have long been admired for their exceptional literary quality, and art historians have sometimes drawn on some of the letters in their analysis of the paintings. And yet, to date, no one has undertaken a critical assessment of this remarkable body of writing—not as a footnote to the paintings but as a highly sophisticated literary achievement in its own right. Patrick Grant’s long-awaited study provides such an assessment and, as such, redresses a significant omission in the field of van Gogh studies. As Grant demonstrates, quite apart from furnishing a highly revealing self-portrait of their author, the letters are compelling for their imaginative and expressive power, as well as for the perceptive commentary they offer on universal human themes. Through a subtle exploration of van Gogh’s contrastive style of thinking and his fascination with the notion of imperfection, Grant illuminates gradual shifts in van Gogh's ideas on religion, ethics, and art. He also analyzes the metaphorical significance of a number of key images in the letters, which prove to yield unexpected psychological and conceptual connections, and probes the relationships that surface when the letters are viewed as a cohesive literary product. The result is a wealth of new insights into van Gogh’s inner landscape.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=c2L7AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Patrick Grant"],firstBook:d,published:"2014-05-01",publisher:"Athabasca University Press",subtitle:"A Critical Study"}},{id:6029,attributes:{title:"Pastoring Men",description:"What would happen if every pastor in America shared the vision to disciple every man in his church—can you imagine? No man falls on purpose, yet our culture is suffering from the fallout of the \"men problem.\" Increasingly men are living autonomous and unexamined lives, getting caught up in the frenzy of life, and becoming satisfied with tasteless and powerless Christianity. Now, more than ever, men need unapologetic guidance and strong discipleship. Here's the place to start. In Pastoring Men, Patrick Morley explains proven and practical strategies for discipleship, equipping pastors to effectively reach and disciple all of the men they shepherd. This book will teach you: The state of men in your church—how they are doing, what they want, what keeps them from getting what they want, and what they need The essential factors for successfully discipling men A concrete, sustainable strategy to help you organize your passion for men's discipleship without a lot of new programming.

The State of Freedom offers an important new take on this classic question by exploring what exactly the state did and how it worked. Patrick Joyce asks us to re-examine the ordinary things of the British state from dusty government files and post offices to well-thumbed primers in ancient Greek and Latin and the classrooms and dormitories of public schools and Oxbridge colleges. This is also a history of the 'who' and the 'where' of the state, of the people who ran the state, the government offices they sat in and the college halls they dined in. Patrick Joyce argues that only by considering these things, people and places can we really understand the nature of the modern state. This is both a pioneering new approach to political history in which social and material factors are centre stage, and a highly original history of modern Britain.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=aDkhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Patrick Joyce"],firstBook:d,published:"2013-04-04",publisher:"Cambridge University Press",subtitle:"A Social History of the British State since 1800"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531351032}}("movie","","series",null,1,"Family Business","Vincent Patrick"))
