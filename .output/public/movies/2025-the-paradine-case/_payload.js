She is up front about being a woman with a past, she only becoming wealthy and thus glamorous because of the marriage. Her personal solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer refers the case to his colleague Tony Keane. In spending time with Mrs. Paradise in prison, Tony is immediately attracted to her, that attraction which morphs into obsession. As such, Tony does whatever he can to clear her of the charges, either in mounting a defense of suicide, assisted or not, or that someone else killed him, the most likely candidate being the Colonel's trusted valet, Andre Latour, with who Tony initially believes Mrs. Paradise was having an affair. In the process, Tony may be blinded to the evidence as it presents itself. Who can see what is going on is Tony's wife Gay Keane, who not only believes their marriage has been a perfect one up to this point, but that he truly does believe his obsession with Mrs. Paradine being love, which Gay herself does not believe it to be. Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.",slug:"the-paradine-case"}}},books:{data:[{id:10090,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=RR2lA135KN0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1933-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:10091,attributes:{title:"Yesterday, the Autobiography of Robert Hichens",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=MCwcAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1947-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10092,attributes:{title:"The Power to Kill",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DHscAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1936-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10093,attributes:{title:"Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["James Bridie",b,"Alma Reville","Ben Hecht"],firstBook:d,published:"1943-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10094,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1946-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377261469}}("","Robert Hichens","movie",null,"The Paradine Case","series",1))
