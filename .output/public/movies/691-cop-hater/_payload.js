Larry Cole has everything a man could want. He loves his wife, Eve, and is devoted to their two small sons. His career as an architect is both creatively satisfying and financially rewarding. His house in suburban Pinecrest Manor is attractive and comfortable. But then Larry sees a new neighbor standing at the school bus stop. Margaret Gault is young, blond, beautiful—and married. She’s everything Larry didn’t realize was missing from his life, and he must have her. Maggie tells Larry she’s never been in love. But this isn’t about love. It’s about need and desire. Touch and taste and risk. And lies. Larry and Maggie surrender to lust, knowing their secret motel rendezvous and lunch-hour trysts will amount to nothing; they will always be strangers to each other. But actions have consequences. And sometimes consequences can be deadly. Author Evan Hunter adapted his riveting novel of infidelity into a film starring Kirk Douglas and Kim Novak.

A decade later, one is happily married to an ambitious lawyer while the other is entangled in a passionate but troubled affair with a young man who’s spent five years in a navy prison.

After serving his country in World War II, Richard Dadier decides to become an English teacher--and for the sin of wanting to make a difference, he's hired at North Manual Trades High School. A tough vocational school in the East Bronx, Manual Trades is home to angry, unruly teenagers exiled from New York City's regular public schools. On his first day, Dadier endures relentless mockery and ridicule and makes an enemy of the student body by rescuing a female colleague from a vicious attack. His fellow educators are bitter, disillusioned, and too afraid of their pupils to risk turning their backs on them in the classroom. But Dadier refuses to give up without a fight. Over the course of the semester, he tries again and again to break through the wall of hatred and scorn and win his students' respect. The more he learns about their difficult circumstances, the more convinced he becomes that a good teacher can make a difference in their lives. His idealism will be put to the ultimate test, however, when a long-simmering power struggle with his most intimidating student explodes into a violent schoolroom showdown. The basis for the blockbuster film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle is a brutal, unflinching look at the dark side of American education and an early masterpiece from the author who went on to write the gritty 87th Precinct series as Ed McBain. Drawn from Hunter's own experiences as a New York City schoolteacher, it is a \"nightmarish but authentic\" drama that packs a knockout punch (Time).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=LzUVtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2017-06-13",publisher:f,subtitle:g}},{id:700,attributes:{title:"Lizzie",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=qJ_lph2wd4QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1984-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069489397}}("movie","","Evan Hunter","series",null,"Open Road Media","A Novel",1,"Cop Hater","2017-06-06"))
