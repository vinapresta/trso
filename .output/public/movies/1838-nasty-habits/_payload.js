The Abbey of Philadelphia is a wealthy, little known order of nuns loosely associated to the Catholic church. Its Mother Abbess, Sister Hildegarde, is on her deathbed. She admits to Alexandra (the Richard Nixon character) that she has always been her favorite of the nuns, and sees her as her heir apparent, while Hildegarde also admits to Alexandra that she has never trusted hard working Sister Felicity (the George McGovern character) and her liberal ideas. Among Felicity's ideas is wanting to turn the abbey into a love abbey, as she is secretly carrying on with a Jesuit priest, Father Thomas. Power hungry Alexandra also sees being Abbess of Philadelphia as her destiny. But Hildegarde dies before her intention of signing the documentation of her official endorsement of Alexandra as Abbess, which would have more than sealed Alexandra's ascension to the position. Alexandra, using her two flunkies, Sister Walburga (the H.R. Haldeman character), the abbey's prioress, and Sister Mildred (the John Ehrlichman character), the mistress of novices, does whatever required to win the upcoming election of Abbess, for which the sisters are not allowed to campaign. Felicity, who has the large and growing support of the younger nuns and the novices (the latter who nonetheless have no voting rights), is Alexandra's biggest threat to an election win. Although Alexandra is the mastermind of the plot to win the election with some strategic assistance by Sister Gertrude (the Henry Kissinger character), who is doing missionary work overseas, she cannot be seen to know anything about any shady dealings. While naive Sister Geraldine (the Gerald Ford character) unwittingly assists Alexandra and her hench-nuns, they turn to Sister Winifred (the John Dean character) as their patsy as they embark on electronic eavesdropping, burglary and bribery. But the election itself is just the start of the potential problems for Alexandra and her crew.",slug:"nasty-habits"}}},books:{data:[{id:9331,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:9332,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:9333,attributes:{title:"The Novels of Muriel Spark",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_xKoAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt",subtitle:b}},{id:9334,attributes:{title:"A Good Comb: The Sayings of Muriel Spark",description:"Celebrate the immortal Muriel Spark’s hundredth birthday by imbibing a delicious glass of her bubbly wit A Good Comb, a small gift edition of Muriel Spark’s brilliant asides, sayings, and aphorisms, is a book for sheer enjoyment. No writer offers such lively, pointed, puckish insights: “Neurotics are awfully quick to notice other people’s mentalities.” “It is impossible to persuade a man who does not disagree, but smiles.” “The sacrifice of pleasure is of course itself a pleasure.” “It is impossible to repent of love. The sin of love does not exist.” “She wasn’t a person to whom things happen.” “You look for one thing and you find another.” “It calms you down, a good comb.” Her scope is great and her striking insights are precise and unforgettable. This book will entertain you—it will even help you live your life. Drink in the pleasures of this little volume along with the benefits of taking up such advice as “Never make excuses but if you must, never make more than one—it gives the appearance of insincerity.” And “Beware of men bearing flowers.”",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1IxDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2018-02-01",publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:9335,attributes:{title:"All the Poems of Muriel Spark",description:"Available at last are all the poems by one of the twentieth century's greatest British writers, Dame Muriel Spark: \"a true literary artist, acerbic and exhilarating\" (London Evening Standard). In the seventy-three poems collected here Muriel Spark works in open forms as well as villanelles, rondels, epigrams, and even the tour de force of a twenty-one page ballad. She also shows herself a master of unforgettable short poems. Before attaining fame as a novelist (Memento Mori, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), Muriel Spark was already an acclaimed poet. The \"power and control\" of her poetry, as Publishers Weekly remarked, \"is almost startling.\" With the vitality and wit typical of all her work, Dame Muriel has never stopped writing poems, which frequently appear in The New Yorker. As with all her creations, the poems show Spark to be \"astonishingly talented and truly inimitable\" (The San Francisco Chronicle).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QgIrfgPFe3cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2004-04-17",publisher:e,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069507330}}("movie","","Muriel Spark","series","New Directions Publishing",null,"1995-01-01",1,"The Abbess of Crewe","This is a satirical fantasy about ecclesiastical and other kinds of politics.
