Her battles against Mordaunt, the ageless Dark Side of God, have been many, but the war is far from over. She destroyed Mordaunt's human body in the deserts of Las Vegas, but his many followers still walk the Earth. They vow to resurrect their Master and exact vengeance upon Eden in a melee of magic and violence. As Eden fights for her life, her doppelganger, Gwen, separates from Eden to fight the battle on another front. In another dimension, the other half of Mordaunt's soul hides within a man living in Jubilation County, Georgia â€“ in the year 1926. To keep Mordaunt powerless, Gwen must travel back in time, but finds that awaiting her arrival is a vicious entity known as Delilah. The epic story that began with The Fury reaches its electrifying conclusion, as unsuspecting worlds merge on the cusp of an age of darkness--a force only one woman, across a vast span of time and space, can stop.
