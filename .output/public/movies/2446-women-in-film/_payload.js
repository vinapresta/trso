With masterful suspense, Bruce Wagner moves among the perspectives of his characters, revealing their individual trauma and the uncanny connections to one another’s past lives. I Met Someone plummets the reader down a rabbit hole of the human psyche, with Wagner’s remarkable insights into our collective obsession with great wealth and fame, and surprises with unimaginable plot turns and unexpected fate.

A masterful, modern-day fantasy of millionaires and madmen, fathers and sons, reality and dreams.\" --Kirkus Reviews Bruce Wagner’s I’m Losing You was hailed as \"outrageous -- dead-on in every way\" by Janet Maslin in The New York Times. New York magazine’s Walter Kirn called it \"the year’s best book.\" And John Updike, in The New Yorker, wrote that Bruce Wagner \"writes like a wizard.\" In I’ll Let You Go, Wagner offers a stunning novel that surpasses anything he’s done before. Twelve-year-old Toulouse \"Tull\" Trotter lives on his grandfather’s vast Bel-Air parkland estate with his mother, the beautiful, drug-addicted Katrina, a landscape artist who specializes in topiary laby-rinths. He spends most of his time with his young cousins Lucy, the girl detective, and Edward, a prodigy undaunted by the disfiguring effects of Apert Syndrome. One day, an impulsive revelation from Lucy sets in motion a chain of events that changes Tull -- and the Trotter family -- forever. Though the story unfolds in contemporary Los Angeles, the reader hears echoes of Proust and 1,001 Nights as Toulouse seeks his lost father, a woman finds her lost love, and a family of unimaginable wealth learns that its fate is tied to those of the orphan Amaryllis (who officially aspires to be a saint) and her protector, a courtly giant of a homeless schizophrenic -- both of them on the run from the law. Along a path shaded by murder and mysticism, we meet such unforgettable characters as Fitzsimmons, a deranged former social worker; the enterprising Monasterio family of servants (Candelaria, Epitacio, and Eulogio); \"Someone-Help-Me\", a streetwise devil; and Pullman, a seemingly ageless Great Dane. Complexly wrought, deeply moving, and scathingly ironic, I'll Let You Go dazzles the reader with the unique blend of gorgeous prose, acerbic wit, and deep emotion that are the specific province of Bruce Wagner.
