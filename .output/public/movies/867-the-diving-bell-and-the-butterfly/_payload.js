He is in a Berck-sur-Mer hospital, where he has been for the past several weeks in a coma after suffering a massive stroke. Although his cognitive facilities are intact, he quickly learns that he has what is called locked-in syndrome which has resulted in him being almost completely paralyzed, including not being able to speak. One of his few functioning muscles is his left eye. His physical situation and hospitalization uncomfortably bring together the many people in his life, including: Céline Desmoulins, his ex-lover and mother of his children; Inès, his current lover; and his aged father who he calls Papinou. Among his compassionate recuperative team are his physical therapist Marie, and his speech therapist Henriette. Henriette eventually teaches him to communicate using a system where he spells out words: she reads out the letters of the alphabet in descending order of their use in the French language, and he blinks his functioning left eye when she reaches the appropriate letter. Although frustrating at start, he learns to communicate effectively but slowly using this method, so much so that with the help of Claude, a full time translator, he decides on the monumental and seemingly impossible task to keep to his pre-injury commitment of writing a book, changing its focus to life in his current state.",slug:"the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly"}}},books:{data:[{id:5309,attributes:{title:c,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:j}},{id:5310,attributes:{title:c,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[d],firstBook:k,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:j}},{id:5311,attributes:{title:"Care and Equality",description:"Examines the changing nature of caregiving--for children, the elderly, the sick, and disabled--traditionally falling to the responsibility of women in the home, as more women move into the workplace, calling for a radical reassessment of the economics of caregiving and the establishment of support systems. 15,000 first printing.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ji6aAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Mona Harrington",d],firstBook:k,published:"1999-01-01",publisher:"Alfred a Knopf Incorporated",subtitle:"Inventing a New Family Politics"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531333258}}("movie","series","The Diving Bell and the Butterfly","Jean-Dominique Bauby",1,"A celebration of the liberating power of consciousness—a triumphant book that lets us witness an indomitable spirit and share in the pure joy of its own survival. In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor-in-chief of French Elle, the father of two young childen, a 44-year-old man known and loved for his wit, his style, and his impassioned approach to life. By the end of the year he was also the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem. After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired. Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose this extraordinary book. By turns wistful, mischievous, angry, and witty, Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do in his body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his aged father's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places and times and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing and tasting the full flavor of delectable dishes. Again and again he returns to an \"inexhaustible reservoir of sensations,\" keeping in touch with himself and the life around him. Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the French publication of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. This book is a lasting testament to his life.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iCzQ4z02cFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2008-03-06","Vintage","",null))
