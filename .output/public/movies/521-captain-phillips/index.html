Ordinary that is until, two hundred or so miles off the east coast of Africa, armed Somali pirates attacked and boarded the freighter as it headed towards the port of Mombasa. It was the first time an American cargo ship had been hijacked in over two-hundred years. What the pirates didn’t expect was that the crew would fight back, nor did they expect Captain Phillips to offer himself as a hostage in exchange for the safety of his crew. And so began a nail-bitingly tense five-day stand-off, which ended in a daring high-seas rescue by U.S. Navy SEALs. In A Captain&#39;s Duty, Richard Phillips tells his own extraordinary story - that of an ordinary man who did what he saw as his duty and in so doing became a hero. It is a thrilling true tale of adventure and courage in the face of deprivation, death threats and mock executions and also a compulsively readable first-hand account of the terrors of high-seas hostage-taking.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb3874"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Captain&#39;s Duty</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Richard Phillips<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Tantor Media Incorporated</span><span><span> - </span>5/10/2014</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Tells the dramatic life-and-death tale of the Vermont native who, in April of 2008, was held captive on a tiny lifeboat off Somalia&#39;s anarchic, gun-plagued shores.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb3875"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=6UxkpvdHvhIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Second Ship" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Second Ship</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Richard Phillips<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by BookPros, LLC</span><span><span> - </span>5/1/2009</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>On the evening of July 3rd, 1947, two starships battled in the night sky over the American Southwest, sending both ships crashing into the high desert.

It is - through director Paul Greengrass&#39;s distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama&#39;s commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips&#39; unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">7.8/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">93%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">82/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about A Captain&#39;s Duty, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
