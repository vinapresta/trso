Owen Phipps is out for revenge. His mission? To expose the man who stole his sister's money and dignity. All he needs is a \"wife\" who can play along. Too bad his last best hope is an actress who tries to mace him with perfume when he offers her the role of a lifetime. Lindy Knight is a real sap. She loves too hard, feels too deep, and often finds herself saying yes when she should be saying \"Let me think about it.\" She can't believe her good fortune when Owen offers her more than enough money to hold off foreclosure until she can find a job. Three weeks at a resort, money she desperately needs, and she gets to help bring a criminal to justice? Score. It seems easy enough until a couples bonding game turns intimate, and they realize how dangerous their mutual attraction could be. Can they keep their hands to themselves long enough to find the evidence Owen needs? Or are the close quarters more temptation than they can handle? Each book in the Guardian for Hire series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.
