Fair wind to Java has many of the same good points,- color, drama, pace, originality; and the same weaknesses,- too many irons in the fire, so that the plot, which as a picaresque adventure of the sea should be fairly direct, bogs down in intricacies. There are dual identities, double loyalties, cross plotting, as Tom Flint ships on the ill-fated Gerrymander under Captain Boll, serving as agent for De Loach, hated by the owner, Culver. Boll determined to wring the last ounce out of his ship, drives his men unmercifully. You get the picture of a sailing ship master of the old regime, driven by ambition and cupidity, but with his likable moments. The voyage to the Dutch Indies; the plotting for wealth in the distribution of counterfeit coin; the search for the mystery leader of the pirates; the double dealing and cross purposes -- all run parallel to the romance of Tom and Harriet Adams, partner of Culver, and in the fate of the Gerrymander. Good adventure, but the interest scatters so that one loses the impetus of climax.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hbYLAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1948-01-01"))
