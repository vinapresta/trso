Using ingenuity and common sense, Hardy builds shelters, forages for food, and learns to care for Betty Sue. But their journey through this hostile wilderness is being tracked by even more hostile men. And, as he struggles to keep them alive, Hardy realizes that their survival may depend on his ability to go far beyond what his father had been able to teach him.

But I have written many stories with entirely different settings which I have long wanted to share with my readers. “I have collected some of these in Yondering. They are glimpses of what my own life was like during the early years. Those were the rough years; often I was hungry, out of work and facing situations such as I have since written about. “Although these stories take place in a variety of locales, they are stories of people living under conditions similar to the way they might have lived on the frontier.

Callaghen’s business is soldiering. For twenty years he’d fought all over the world, from China to the deserts of California; now he’s a private in the U.S. Cavalry, poorly paid, his enlistment about to run out. He’s ready to move on . . . until he comes across a startling discovery: a treasure map belonging to a dead lieutenant who may not have been all that he seemed. The map points the way to an underground river of gold . . . or does it? To find out, Callaghen will have to fight the toughest war of his life: against a fierce Indian warrior, a vindictive commanding officer, and a ruthless gang of outlaws who’ll turn what may be a river of gold into a river of blood.
