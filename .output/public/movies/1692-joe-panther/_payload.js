But when Gina, a mother who breast-feeds, joins the staff, things begin to change: the company falls under political sabotage, orders are rerouted, and the building is shut down. As the play comes to its climax, the boss, Joe De Martini, suspects either himself or Gina of madness as he sees devil shadows and child assassins, and Gina's body is possessed by an ancient Greek spirit. Despite these fantastic circumstances, Stuart concludes on a realistic note, which jars the reader into reevaluating the gender-based power structure and the illusions that support it.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1yFaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Kelly Stuart"],firstBook:c,published:"2003-01-01",publisher:"Green Integer Books",subtitle:b}},{id:1169,attributes:{title:"Things Worth Fighting for",description:"Presents a collection of magazine and newspaper stories, articles, and columns by the notable journalist, who was killed in 2003 while covering the Iraq war.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DKwK76kPQt8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Michael Kelly"],firstBook:c,published:"2004-01-01",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:"Collected Writings"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377308910}}("movie","",null,"series",1))
