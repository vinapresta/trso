Witty, compassionate, and wry, it captures the social, political, and spiritual upheavals of those decades through the experiences of a middle-class couple, their four children, and the changing worlds in which they live. While Michael and Annie Keane taste the alternately intoxicating and bitter first fruits of the sexual revolution, their older, more tentative brother, Jacob, lags behind, until he finds himself on the way to Vietnam. Meanwhile, Clare, the youngest child of their aging parents, seeks to maintain an almost saintly innocence. After This, alive with the passions and tragedies of a determining era in our history, portrays the clash of traditional, faith-bound life and modern freedom, while also capturing, with McDermott's inimitable understanding and grace, the joy, sorrow, anger, and love that underpin, and undermine, what it is to be a family.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hc2xBC7Q9IQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2006-09-05",publisher:e,subtitle:f}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940912366}}("Alice McDermott","That Night","",null,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","A Novel","The emotionally powerful story of young love set in suburban Long Island in the 60s.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kzTMeZcASAsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2005-02-21"))
