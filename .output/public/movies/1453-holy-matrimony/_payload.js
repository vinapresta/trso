He is, however, extremely shy – so shy that when his valet, Henry Leek, dies suddenly, the doctor believes the dead man to be Priam Farll and the live man the valet. The artist does not try to disabuse him. After the funeral , Priam Farll marries a widow and lives a happy life until the loss of his wife's money means he has to take up painting again. A connoisseur of art recognises his style but thinks the paintings are by an imposter. He makes a fortune by buying his works through a small dealer and selling them in America as genuine. Meanwhile Priam Farll refuses through his obstinate shyness to prove his own identity. The Old Wives Tale (1908), a novel set in part in the Potteries district of North Staffordshire, where Bennett grew up, is generally considered his single masterpiece. The Card is a short comic novel written by Arnold Bennett in 1911. It chronicles the rise of Edward Henry (\"Denry\") Machin from washerwoman's son to Mayor of Bursley (a fictitious town based on Burslem). This is accomplished through luck, initiative and a fair bit of chutzpah (in slang a card is a 'character', an 'original'; a clever, audacious, person). Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) was an English journalist, novelist, and writer. After working as a rent collector and solicitor's clerk, Bennett won a writing contest which convinced him to become a journalist. He later turned to the writing of novels, including his most famous Clayhanger and Anna of the five towns.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=005ODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2017-12-06",publisher:"e-artnow",subtitle:a}},{id:7732,attributes:{title:"Buried Alive by Arnold Bennett - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)",description:"This eBook features the unabridged text of ‘Buried Alive by Arnold Bennett - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)’ from the bestselling edition of ‘The Complete Works of Arnold Bennett’.
