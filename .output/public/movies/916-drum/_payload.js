He grows up to be a fighter and is often forced to bare-knuckle-box other slaves for the entertainment of the owners, including gay Frenchman Bernard. Bernard wants to sleep with Drum and vows revenge against him when he rejects him. Drum and his friend Blaise are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond and taken to his plantation to work. Hammond also purchases Regine and brings her to the plantation as his own personal bedwench, but Hammond's fiancée Augusta is jealous and has other plans for her. Hammond's daughter Sophie wants to sleep with Drum, but he won't for fear of being killed. Sophie also attempts to sleep with Blaise; after he rejects her, she tells her father that he raped her. It's a lie, but Hammond puts Blaise in chains and decides to have him castrated for the alleged rape. In fact, the best way to castrate a slave is a conversation topic at the dinner party that has been arranged to celebrate Hammond and Augusta's engagement; Bernard is a guest. During the party Drum frees Blaise from his chains, and the other slaves launch a violent uprising. Bernard shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum grabs Bernard's privates and rips them off. Both slaves and slavers are killed during the battle, but Drum saves Hammond and Augusta.",slug:"drum"}}},books:{data:[{id:5494,attributes:{title:f,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9x1bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:"Fawcett",subtitle:a}},{id:5495,attributes:{title:f,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:h,publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:5496,attributes:{title:"Drum, Etc",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1963-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:5497,attributes:{title:"Mandingo",description:"This is the original uncut, unedited, uncensored and unabridged Denlinger's 1957 version of Mandingo, a sensational novel based on the Antebellum Period of American history before the Civil War.

No less an authority than President Thomas Jefferson wrote, \" A] woman who brings a child every year is more profitable than the best man. What she produces is an addition to the capital, while his labors disappear in mere consumption.\" The novel takes place in 1832 on Falconhurst, a fictional plantation in Alabama. This book was the first of a series of fictional works, including plays, movies and TV shows by various authors, all of which take place at Falconhurst. In the movie version, Mede, the male slave whose job it is to impregnate the female slaves (a good job), is played appropriately by Ken Norton, who was World Heavyweight Boxing Champion in 1978, defeating Muhammad Ali.
