The crew, made up of Antareans and Brigade members, was on a dual mission to extract the sleeping cocooned Antarean army and deliver a wondrous cargo, which included twenty-two pregnant Brigade female “seniors” and one young pregnant Penditan bride to give birth on Earth. The physical processing that had prepared the Geriatric Brigade for deep space travel had stopped, and then slowly reversed, the physiological mechanics of human aging. Among deep space travelers there exists one overriding directive regarding the birth of interplanetary offspring, especially those of a “mixed mating.” This directive requires that these Brigade mothers-to-be return to Earth to give birth. While the cocooned Antarean army was extracted from their secret underwater chamber, the children of the Geriatric Brigade were born. Even as infants, it was clear that the children of the Geriatric Brigade were evolved—a new race possessing new and extraordinary powers. But how these wondrous gifts would affect the children, and their future, was still unknown. Metamorphosis is the sequel to the New York Times bestselling Cocoon trilogy and continues where Cocoon left off—keeping you hooked from the first page and never letting go.

The children have been secreted, protected, nourished, educated, and loved at Butterfly House, a private compound on Cayman Brac in the Caribbean—the smallest and most remote of the Cayman Islands. Aside from their guardians, teachers, and a few trusted people in the United States, no one else on Earth knows of their existence. Most of those who helped in their births believe the children left with their parents on the Antarean Mothership, and of those who know where they live, only a few suspect how very special and talented these children are or what their potential might be. To the Brigade, the chance to leave Earth and enter the realm of deep space travel occurred by chance—an accident of time and place. “But was it an accident?” the Brigade’s commanders had wondered. The Antareans’ answer was simple: “Nothing in the Master’s Plan is accidental.” If the children of Butterfly House were to leave their home planet and if they had no contact with Earth again, what might future Earth-human space travelers find in millennia from now? Would the Brigade still exist? Would their offspring and generations beyond have joined the Brigade? The children of Butterfly House know the answers, and the Universe is about to find out! In the final installment of the New York Times bestselling Cocoon trilogy, Butterfly shows the effect of the children of Butterfly House and what they hold for the future of mankind.

Six single, semi-retired, “older” women are inseparable friends. But their lives start to go haywire when mischievous Rosie submits her friends’ names to an ad soliciting “Mail Order Brides for Farmers & Miners—Distant Locations.” A few weeks later, as the six women are driving along a lonely beach road, their vehicle suddenly begins to shake, the sky grows dark, an eerie light envelops the van, and ZAP—it’s gone! Exactly three years later, the van reappears on the same road. But this time, the women appear to be thirty years younger—and they’re all pregnant! The “distant locations” advertised were, in fact, elsewhere in our galaxy. A process, required for deep space travel, has somehow reversed their aging. They are happy with their new lives. However, a universal law requires that babies of “mixed-mating” be born on the mother’s home planet, forcing their return. But as they re-adapt to life on earth, surprises and problems arise as they’re faced with a media circus, doctors, nurses, police, priests, and nuns, not to mention their new humanoid mates. In Saperstein’s wacky, comedic-drama tradition that’s out of this world, Snatched builds to an exciting, uplifting climax that celebrates life, love, and the universal condition known as family.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=o8GdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2015-05-19",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377259211}}("David Saperstein","movie",null,"","series",1,"Cocoon","Talos"))
