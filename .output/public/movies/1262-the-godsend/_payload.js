But they wish they had just one more, a beautiful baby daughter. So when a strange young woman abandons her infant at their house, they view it as a blessing-a godsend-and adopt little Bonnie as their own. But it is not long after Bonnie's arrival before terrible things begin to happen to the Marlowe family, beginning with the death of their son Matthew. As the tragedies mount, Alan starts to suspect Bonnie and fears he may be losing his grip on his sanity. After all, surely such a small, lovely, innocent child could not possibly be responsible for such horrors ... ? The classic first novel by Bernard Taylor, \"The Godsend\" (1976) earned widespread critical acclaim on its initial publication and was the basis for a 1980 film. This edition, the first in over twenty years, features a new introduction by Mary Danby.

In 'Travelling Light', a traveller is obliged to share a room with a strange man who seems to know a little too much about a series of bizarre murders in which wives have been slain by their husbands. A tourist fascinated by the serial killer John Reginald Christie undergoes an uncanny and horrific experience on a trip to London in 'Forget-Me-Not'. And in 'Samhain', marital strife threatens to turn deadly when a witch turns to black magic to do away with her pathetic husband. The thirteen stories collected here represent the complete short fiction of Bernard Taylor, one of the bestselling horror authors of the 1970s and '80s, author of The Godsend and Mother's Boys, both adapted for film, and Sweetheart, Sweetheart, hailed by Charles L. Grant as the finest ghost story of all time. In these tales, which often feature an unexpectedly cruel or bizarre twist, Taylor offers a clever mixture of horror and black humour that will delight fans of the genre.
