A dedicated agricultural scientist, Dr. Owen Dawnay has set up a lonely post on the outskirts of Colombia’s Amazon River to study the flora that thrives in one of the most remote and inhospitable regions on the face of the Earth. But deep in the heart of darkness, he stumbles across a terrifying nightmare of brutality and death. The behavior of the local population is odd, full of superstitions and terrors. The native villagers fear music and the night, huddling silently in their homes after sunset. They claim that evil spirits emerge from the trees at night to dance—and feed. As a man of science, Dr. Dawnay refuses to believe in the supernatural, yet the mystery behind the fearful beliefs draws him in. But the closer he gets to unraveling the truth, the more he begins to doubt both his science and his sanity. And soon, even in the farthest corners of the rain forest, there will be nowhere left for him to hide . . . A stunning example of thoughtful and thought-provoking suspense fiction, Dance of the Dwarfs is a must-read blend of science and superstition, sanity and madness—a deserving heir to The Island of Dr. Moreau and a spiritual predecessor to the works of Michael Crichton.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Vrp8BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2015-03-24",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:b}},{id:4845,attributes:{title:"Rogue Male",description:"1930-something: a professional hunter is passing through an unnamed Central European country that is in the thrall of a vicious dictator. The hunter wonders whether he can penetrate undetected into the dictator’s private compound. He does. He has the potential target in his sites and is wondering whether to pull the trigger when security catches up with him. Imprisoned, tortured, doomed to a painful death, the hunter makes an extraordinary and harrowing escape, fleeing through enemy territory to the safety of his native England. But that safety is delusive: his pursuers will not be diverted from their revenge by national borders; the British government cannot protect him without seeming to endorse his deed. The hunter must flee society, and he goes literaly underground, like a fox to its earth. The hunter has become the hunted. Geoffrey Household’s Rogue Male is a classic thriller and a triumph of suspense. Described by Household as a “bastard offspring of Stevenson and Conrad,” the book is no less remarkable as an exploration of the lure of violence, the psychology of survivalism, and the call of the wild.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CKJzSMuskVoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2010-12-08",publisher:"New York Review of Books",subtitle:b}},{id:4846,attributes:{title:"Household Mss",description:"Consist of correspondence and writings of Geoffrey Edward West Household.
