Although Laura supports her husband's story, the local paper has reported that the police surgeon can find no evidence that she has been raped. Manion is defended by Paul Biegler (James Stewart), a humble small-town lawyer and recently deposed district attorney. During the course of interviews, Biegler discovers that Manion is violently possessive and jealous, and also that his wife has a reputation for flirting with other men. Biegler realizes that the prosecution will try to make the court believe that Laura had been drunk and was picked up by the bartender and then her husband killed him and beat her up when he discovered they had been together. Manion pleads \"not guilty\" and Biegler, who knows that his case is weak, tries to find evidence that will save Manion.",slug:"anatomy-of-a-murder"}}},books:{data:[{id:2324,attributes:{title:g,description:"Defense attorney Paul Biegler represents a young Army lieutenant who claims that the man he shot had raped his wife",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2HH0D5SVONIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"1983-03-15",publisher:"Macmillan",subtitle:b}},{id:2325,attributes:{title:"Trout Magic",description:"\"Trout Magic\" is a warm, joyous, and maverick look at trout fishing and its attendant tall tales. strange happenings, and all-around fishing lore.

The book is analytical, concise, and thorough. Empirical studies show that many lawyers are unaware of even basic information about legal ethics, the law governing lawyers. Older lawyers, who draw a disproportionate number of malpractice suits, often have neither formally studied ethics nor kept up with developments in the law. Many malpractice suits arise out of ethics violations, such as disqualification of lawyers for conflicts of interest, multi-disciplinary practice, and the attorney-client evidentiary and ethical privilege. The Ethics Rules are law typically adopted by court rule in the same way that the Rules of Civil Procedure are law. These Ethics Rules are just as complex as the Civil Practice Rules or the Evidence Rules. Many of the Ethics Rules cannot be known through some sort of innate or hereditary awareness automatically infused in ordinary human beings once they are admitted to the bar. Unless a student wants to emulate those lawyers who draw a disproportionate number of malpractice suits, he or she will need to understand the law of Legal Ethics. And to do that, one needs this book.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Wvo2AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[k,l],firstBook:d,published:"2008-08-08",publisher:"West Academic Publishing",subtitle:"A Student's Guide"}},{id:2327,attributes:{title:"Legal Ethics",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OVVPAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[k,l],firstBook:d,published:"2010-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:"The Lawyer's Deskbook on Professional Responsibility : 2010-2011"}},{id:2328,attributes:{title:"Trout Madness",description:"21 marvelous yarns and stories gleaned from a lifetime of glorious fishing by the author of Anatomy of a Murder.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DL8GPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[h,e],firstBook:d,published:i,publisher:j,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069429801}}("movie","","series",null,"Robert Traver",1,"Anatomy of a Murder","John Donaldson Voelker","2000-01-01","Lyons Press","Ronald D.
