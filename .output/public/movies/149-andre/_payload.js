Andre swims with Harry and rides happily in the back seat of Harry’s car. He quickly picked up tricks—perhaps the first time a wild animal has been trained in a free-release situation. He became Rockport, Maine’s honorary harbormaster and was ranked “second only to Andrew Wyeth as the state’s most acclaimed summer resident.” Year after year, Andre swam south in the winter, only to return again to Harry the next spring. It’s a timeless and iconic Maine story.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wfPDBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Lew Dietz","2014-10-07","Down East Books",null))
