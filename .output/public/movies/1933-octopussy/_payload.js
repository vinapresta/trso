OCTOPUSSY is set in Fleming’s favourite pleasure paradise, Jamaica in the British West Indies.

M. sends Bond to West Berlin to safeguard the escape of Number 272, a British agent who is privy to Russia’s top-secret atomic plans. Agent 272 is to make his break for freedom across the East Berlin frontier. The big trouble is: the KGB knows the escape plan and that plan cannot be changed. They have assigned their best sniper, Trigger, to shoot 272 on the run, on a certain street, at a certain time. Armed with a .308-caliber International Experimental Target rifle, Bond must stake out the sniper and kill him before he kills 272...","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=N_IwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2017-07-11","Pickle Partners Publishing"))
