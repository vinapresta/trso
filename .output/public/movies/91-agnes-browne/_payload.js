At forty-seven years of age Agnes, now thirteen years happily widowed, enters the 1980s with a fruit stall in Moore Street, a French lover and six children, five of them in their twenties. Becoming a grandmother is a terrible shock to her system, especially as Agnes suffers every one of her daughter-in-law's labour pains! And as the family expands so do the problems -one son's inevitable brush with the law, the heartbreak of emigration. But Agnes Browne is nothing if not a fighter, and she squares her shoulders, offers up a quick one to her departed pal, Marion, and sets about getting things back on an even keel - or as even as things ever get in the Brown household! The same quick-fire dialogue, hilarious humour and great characterisation as in Brendan's bestselling The Mammy, filmed as Agnes Browne by Angelica Huston, and the BAFTA-winning TV series Mrs Brownâ€™s Boys.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DWiNAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2012-11-15",publisher:e,subtitle:b}},{id:425,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:b}},{id:426,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309117196}}("Brendan O'Carroll","","movie",null,"The O'Brien Press","series",1,"The Mammy","The first book in the Agnes Browne trilogy Agnes Browne is a widow of only a few hours when she goes to the Social Welfare Office. Living in James Larkin Flats, with Redsers' legacy - seven little Brownes - to support on the income from her Moore Street stall, she can't afford to miss a day's pension. Life is like that for Agnes and her best pal Marion. But they still have time for a laugh and a jar, and Agnes even has a dream - that one day she will dance with Cliff Richard. The Mammy describes the life and times, the joys and sorrows of Agnes, mother of the famous Mrs. Browne's Boys from the daily radio soap. A book of hilarious incidents, glorious characters, and a passion for life, it is written with a sure touch and great ear for dialogue. 'Hilarious and irreverent. A must-read.'
