In order to supply eastern cities with beef, former Confederates from Texas drove their herds to the rail-heads in Missouri. After a long and hard cattle drive through the Bad Lands, former Confederate officer Chad Morgan and his partners arrive at a rail-head in Missouri where corrupt cattle buyer Brog and his gunfighter partner offer to purchase the Texans' herds for a pitiful sum. Brog knows the cattle are weakened by the long drive from Texas and cannot survive a return drive to Texas. He also knows the Texans are desperate to sell for any amount of money they can settle for. After selling their herds to crooked buyer Brog, the Texans blame their partner Chad Morgan for their misfortune. It was Chad who suggested they sell their herds in Missouri. Heartbroken, Chad splits with his partners. On a rainy night, Chad is refused lodging by embittered Northerners who still see him as a Confederate enemy. He finally finds shelter in a livery stable where he meets Joe Jagger, a likable Yankee who likes the whiskey too much. The two become friends after Chad saves Joe from being lynched by men whose booze Joe was trying to steal. At gunpoint, the two pals make their getaway from the livery stable and into the night. They decide to head for Kansas where their fortunes would eventually change.",slug:"the-big-land"}}},books:{data:[{id:537,attributes:{title:"Buffalo Grass",description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:["Frank Gruber"],firstBook:true,published:"1957-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309146185}}("movie","","series",1))
