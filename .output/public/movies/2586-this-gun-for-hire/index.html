Born out of a brutal childhood, Raven is an assassin for hire whose latest hit—a government minister—is one calculated to ignite a war. When the most wanted man in England is paid off in marked bills, he also becomes the easiest to track—and police detective Jimmy Mather has the lead. But Raven’s got an advantage. Crossing paths with a sympathetic dancer named Anne Crowder, the emotionally scarred Raven has found someone in the wreckage of his life he can trust, maybe his only hope for salvation. Or at least, escape—because Anne is also Mather’s fiancée. Now the fate of two men will depend on her. And either way, it’s betrayal. With its themes of deception, double cross, and the consequences of indiscriminate passion, the breathless cinematic narrative of Graham Greene’s thriller became a perfect fit for the classic 1942 film noir starring Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12427"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=EQ05WYmuCz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Conversations with Graham Greene" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Conversations with Graham Greene</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Graham Greene<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Univ.

Here the eminent author of The Power and the Glory, The Third Man, and The Heart of the Matter speaks of himself, his life, and his works. Though reluctant to be interviewed, especially by an academic or journalist he did not know, Greene was more at ease in an interview with a personal friend, who he felt would be less likely to misunderstand or misquote him. Yet even his good friend V. S. Pritchett spent considerable time trying to pin him down for his 1978 interview. When he finally did arrange an interview, Pritchett tells that Greene&#39;s &quot;flat conspiratorial, laughing voice . . ., of itself, makes him the best company I&#39;ve known in the last forty years&quot;. Other interviewers--included here are V. S. Naipaul and Penelope Gilliatt--shared Pritchett&#39;s opinion, but many found that he avoided idle conversation for fear that his words would be misconstrued. Greene&#39;s anxiety was not without foundation. In an interview with Michael Menshaw, Greene explained: &quot;It&#39;s got so I hate to say who I am or what I believe...A few years ago I told an interviewer I&#39;m a gnostic. The next day&#39;s newspaper announced that I had become an agnostic&quot;. After such incidents, Greene turned to the anecdote--relating an experience with Fidel Castro or with Papa Doc Duvalier--to communicate in interviews with strangers. Nevertheless, in all the interviews Greene granted over the years, the reader hears very clearly the voice of a man whose conversation is as painfully honest and unpretentious as is his written prose. The interviews here are divided chronologically into four periods, loosely related to his subject matter or to his reputation at the time of theinterview. Thus the reader sees the development of the writer from a callow but gifted young man into one of the foremost men of letters in the English-speaking world.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12428"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Graham Greene&#39;s Works</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Graham Greene<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->1/1/1955</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p></p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12429"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=VrF1DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Collected Novels Volume Three" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Collected Novels Volume Three</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Graham Greene<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Open Road Media</span><span><span> - </span>11/6/2018</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Three compelling novels from the British author who has been hailed as “one of the finest writers of any language” (The Washington Post). In these novels of international intrigue and domestic drama, political injustice and crime, and the possibility of redemption, Graham Greene once again emerges as “the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man’s consciousness and anxiety” (William Golding, Nobel Prize–winning author of Lord of the Flies). Orient Express: The Orient Express has embarked on a three-day journey from Ostend to Cologne, Vienna, and Constantinople. The passenger list includes a Jewish trader from London with business interests in Turkey—and a score to settle; a vulnerable chorus girl on her last legs; a boozy and spiteful journalist who’s found an unrequited love in her paid companion, and her latest scoop in second class: a Serbian dissident in disguise on his way to lead a revolution; and a murderer on the run looking for a getaway. As the train hurtles across Europe, the fates of everyone on board will collide long before the Orient Express rushes headlong to its final destination. “Interesting and entertaining.” —The New York Times It’s a Battlefield: In pre–World War II London, during a demonstration in Hyde Park, Communist bus driver Jim Drover acts on instinct to protect his wife by stabbing to death the policeman set to strike her down. Sentenced to hang—whether as a martyr, tool, or murderer—Drover accepts his lot, unaware that the ramifications of the crime, and the battle for his reprieve, are inflaming political unrest. But Drover’s single, impulsive act is also upending the lives of the people he loves and trusts. Caught in a quicksand of desperation, sexual betrayal, and guilt, they will not only play a part in Drover’s fate, they’ll become agents—both unwitting and calculated—of their own fates as well. “Adventurous . . . intelligent . . . ingenious.” —V. S. Pritchett A Gun for Sale: Born out of a brutal childhood, Raven is an assassin for hire whose latest hit—a government minister—is calculated to ignite a war. When the most wanted man in England is paid off in marked bills, he also becomes the easiest to track—and police detective Jimmy Mather has the lead. But Raven’s got an advantage.
