As she races south from Paris in a stolen sports car, she has no idea where she is going or why. Nearsighted behind her shades and timid beneath her bravado, she's oblivious to the sinister maze of sex, deception, and murder that surrounds her. But throughout the journey, Dany finds traces of herself along the way — even in places she has never been. Is she the killer the police are looking for? Has she plunged into someone else's nightmare? Or is she a pawn in a deadly game? The answer lies within four elements: the lady, the car, the glasses, and a gun, each of which holds a clue to Dany's identity and her deadly secret. \"A grand master!\" — Kirkus Reviews \"Japrisot is a magician who gives voice to silence and lays out truth naked on the page.\" — Le Monde",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ZESlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2019-10-16",publisher:"Dover Publications",subtitle:a}},{id:9192,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b,"Helen Weavel"],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:"Corgi",subtitle:a}},{id:9193,attributes:{title:"The Passion of Women",description:"A young newlywed, a prostitute, a Hollywood bombshell, a Japanese art student, and a lawyer all fall in love with the same Frenchman, who appears in a very different guise to each",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yN9PAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1990-01-01",publisher:"Crown Pub",subtitle:f}},{id:9194,attributes:{title:"A Very Long Engagement",description:"Set during and after the First World War, A Very Long Engagement tells the story of a young woman's search for her fiancé, whom she believes might still be alive despite having officially been reported as \"killed in the line of duty.\" Unable to walk since childhood, fearless Mathilde Donnay is undeterred in her quest as she scours the country for information about five wounded French soldiers who were brutally abandoned by their own troops.
