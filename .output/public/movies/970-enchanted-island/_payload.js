It's decided to send a party on land to search for fresh drinking water and provisions. The captain refuses to give his sailors shore leave for two reasons. The first, he's worried about the existence of cannibals on the island. Second, he's a puritan and therefore concerned about his sailors' fraternizing with local native women. After many months at sea and frustrated with their tyrannical captain, the seamen are desperate for shore leave which the captain is contractually obligated to give. A fistfight between the captain and sailors Abner Bedford and Tom ensues. The captain is knocked out and the two seamen, fearing retribution, desert the ship. They rush into the jungle where two native tribes supposedly live. One tribe, the Happar, is presumably friendly toward visitors while the other tribe, the Typee, is cannibalistic. The two tribes are mortal enemies. Running away from Captain Vangs and his men, the two deserters end up in a native village. There, Fayaway, the grand-daughter of the tribal chief Mehevi, helps them. Eventually, the two deserters, Abner and Tom, are accepted by the tribe and partake in the tribe's daily life. They hope to someday leave the island by catching another passing ship. What the two sailors don't know is that their adoptive tribe is the feared cannibalistic Typee tribe.",slug:"enchanted-island"}}},books:{data:[{id:5737,attributes:{title:a,description:"Melville's first and most popular novel during his lifetime, Typee is a provocative and lively account of his exploits in the exotic South Seas during the early 1840s, where he journeyed as a young sailor.

Most of his writings were published between 1846 and 1857. Best known for his sea adventure Typee (1846) and his whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851), he was almost forgotten during the last thirty years of his life. Melville's writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change. The main characteristic of his style is probably pervasive allusion, reflecting his written sources. Melville's way of adapting what he read for his own new purposes, scholar Stanley T.
