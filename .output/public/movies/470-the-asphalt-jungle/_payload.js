You won't be able to look away until the bitter end as the motley gang prepares for, and then carries out, the heist, and as this easy \"knockover\" begins to fall apart due to bad luck and a series of blunders by the main characters. The story is enhanced by the warring impulses that torment Roy Earle, who longs desperately for his tranquil, rural roots, but who has spent too much of his life among thugs and killers to ever be completely normal again. Written by W.R. Burnett, the author of Little Caesar and Asphalt Jungle and one of the most important chroniclers of the American criminal class in the early twentieth century, the Gutter Books edition is complete with a new forward and a fun glossary of the gangster terminology used in the book.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UUWTMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2012-08-01",publisher:"Gutter Books",subtitle:b}},{id:3679,attributes:{title:"Little Men, Big World\u002FVanity Row",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=PkYLrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:null,published:"2015-05-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}},"9EdY7FwJjp":{data:[{id:2745,attributes:{type:d,item_lang:{data:{id:3412,attributes:{title:"House of the Dragon",slug:"house-of-the-dragon"}}}}},{id:2747,attributes:{type:a,item_lang:{data:{id:3414,attributes:{title:"Bullet Train",slug:"bullet-train"}}}}},{id:2752,attributes:{type:a,item_lang:{data:{id:3419,attributes:{title:"White Noise",slug:"white-noise"}}}}},{id:2765,attributes:{type:a,item_lang:{data:{id:3432,attributes:{title:"Argylle",slug:"argylle"}}}}},{id:2772,attributes:{type:d,item_lang:{data:{id:3439,attributes:{title:"Super Pumped",slug:"super-pumped"}}}}}],meta:{pagination:{page:e,pageSize:25,pageCount:e,total:5}}}},prerenderedAt:1682568394095}}("movie","","W.
