Not knowing what to expect on his mission to shed light on his opaque past, grizzled Noodles reunites with his only living friend Fat Moe after 35 haunted years of self-exile. However, the relentless, piercing sound of culpability stands in the way of finding closure, as the inscrutable content of a well-worn leather suitcase further complicates matters. And now, against the backdrop of a torn conscience, the sad, bittersweet recollections of more than 50 years of love, death, and everything in-between become inextricably intertwined, leading to even more puzzling questions. But what are a man's options when he is left with nothing?",slug:"once-upon-a-time-in-america"}}},books:{data:[{id:9851,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Harry GREY (pseud.)"],firstBook:true,published:"1965-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:9852,attributes:{title:c,description:"This book by Harry Grey - an ex-hood himself - will shock.

Covering the region north of the U.S. border, south of Prince George, east of Manning Park and west into the Rockies, Birds of Interior BC and the Rockies is for beginning and intermediate birders who wish to identify the birds they regularly spot in this area. However, the book will also appeal to more experienced local and visiting birders who want to learn more about the behavior, habitat and seasonal occurrence of local birds. Packed with useful information, this handy, portable guide tells you how to identify local birds, find out where they live and what they eat, how to attract birds to your yard and how to select a pair of binoculars. Identification is made easy with more than 400 sharp, full-color photos illustrating over 200 species of birds, in the plumage most likely seen in the region and color-coded by species. There's even a checklist to record your sightings.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=F4XP_sEMvUwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Richard Cannings","Harry B.
