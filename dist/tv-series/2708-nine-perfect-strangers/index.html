In Liane Moriartyâs latest page-turner, nine perfect strangers are about to find out... Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they canât even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be. Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. Sheâs immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them donât look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didnât even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer â or should she run while she still can? Itâs not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question. Combining all of the hallmarks that have made her writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, Liane Moriartyâs Nine Perfect Strangers once again shows why she is a master of her craft.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12901"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-yellow"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=pOxWDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Nine Perfect Strangers" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Nine Perfect Strangers</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Liane Moriarty<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Flatiron Books</span><span><span> - </span>11/6/2018</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Now a Hulu original series âIf three characters were good in Big Little Lies, nine are even better in Nine Perfect Strangers.â âLisa Scottoline, The New York Times Book Review From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Big Little Lies Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever?
