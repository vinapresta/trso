Fourteen-year-old Jack knows how. Or rather he&#39;s learning how. He&#39;s discovering that he has a knack for fixing things. Not bikes or toys or appliancesâsituations.... It all starts when Jack and his best friends, Weezy and Eddie, discover a rotting corpseâthe victim of ritual murderâin the fabled New Jersey Pine Barrens. Beside the body is an ancient artifact carved with strange designs. What is its secret? What is the secret of the corpse? What other mysteries hide in the dark, timeless Pine Barrens? And who doesn&#39;t want them revealed? Jack&#39;s town, the surrounding Barrens, his friends, even Jack himself...they all have...Secret Histories.

He removes a small box from his pocket and presses a button. As he waits for the south tower to collapse, he thinks: The vast majority will blame the collapse on the crazy Arabs who hijacked the planes and the Islamic extremists who funded themâthe obvious choice. A few will notice inconsistencies and point fingers elsewhere, blaming the government or Big Oil or some other powerful but faceless entity. No oneâabsolutely no oneâwill guess the truth behind the who and why of this day. Years later, someone does. Repairman Jack&#39;s childhood friend, Weezy Connell (the genius girl from the Tor Teen novel, Jack: Secret Histories), has started fitting together the pieces of the puzzle and anonymously posting her conclusions on the Web. But she can&#39;t stay anonymous forever. Someone is after her. Jack becomes involved in her troubles and in the paranoid mazes of the 9/11 Truth Movement, where conspiracy theories point in every direction. They&#39;re all wrong. The truth is stranger, darker, and more evil than anyone can imagine. It involves the cosmic shadow war into which Jack has been drafted. And if the plot behind it--millennia in the planning--succeeds, it will forever change life on this Earth.
