Fox invites the reader into a life so full-from his mother dressing him up in women's clothing to his father coercing him into medical school; his search for belonging in the \"families\" of academia, publishing, beatniks and hipsters, Latin America, transsexuals, Judaism, and his own progeny; and the seemingly-glamorous whirlwind world of the arts and culture-that it leaves little else to be desired. Originally from Chicago, Fox studied culture intensely and traveled widely becoming thoroughly Latinized by early adulthood. Much of Fox's life was shaped by his international interests-from his publishing and academic careers to his personal tastes and selection in women-which factored largely into his career successes and personal adventures. Never one to be content with the average or mundane, Fox keeps the pace moving with one exciting revelation or humorously self-interested remark after another. The picture of self-awareness-and -actualization?-Fox's question of Who, Me? has not so much to do with the author\u002Fpoet\u002Fscholar he's become as it does with how he evolved into this multifaceted character of his own creation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tUWPZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Hugh Fox"],firstBook:true,published:"2011-06-12",publisher:"Sunbury Press, Incorporated",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:11829,attributes:{title:"Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman",description:c,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7msEAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["William Godwin"],firstBook:d,published:"1798-01-01",publisher:c,subtitle:c}},{id:11830,attributes:{title:"The Women of the Copper Country",description:"From the bestselling and award-winning author of The Sparrow comes “historical fiction that feels uncomfortably relevant today” (Kirkus Reviews) about “America’s Joan of Arc”—the courageous woman who started a rebellion by leading a strike against the largest copper mining company in the world. In July 1913, twenty-five-year-old Annie Clements has seen enough of the world to know that it’s unfair. She’s spent her whole life in the mining town of Calumet, Michigan, where men risk their lives for meager salaries—and have barely enough to put food on the table for their families. The women labor in the houses of the elite, and send their husbands and sons deep underground each day, dreading the fateful call of the company man telling them their loved ones aren’t coming home. So, when Annie decides to stand up for the entire town of Calumet, nearly everyone believes she may have taken on more than she is prepared to handle. Yet as Annie struggles to improve the future of her town, her husband becomes increasingly frustrated with her growing independence. She faces the threat of prison while also discovering a forbidden love. On her fierce quest for justice, Annie will see just how much she is willing to sacrifice for the families of Calumet. From one of the most versatile writers in contemporary fiction, this novel is an authentic and moving historical portrait of the lives of the crucial men and women of the early labor movement “with an important message that will resonate with contemporary readers” (Booklist).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=r2vqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Mary Doria Russell"],firstBook:d,published:"2020-07-07",publisher:"Atria Books",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:11831,attributes:{title:"Journal Luminescent Butterflies",description:"This 120-page journal features: 117 wide-ruled lined pages 5.5\" x 8.5\" size - big enough for your writing and small enough to take with you smooth 55# cream-color paper, perfect for ink, gel pens, pencils or colored pencils a cover page where you can enter your name and other information a beautiful full-color cover illustration of luminescent butterflies in flight that wraps around the front and back covers a matte-finish cover for an elegant, professional look and feel This journal can be used for writing poetry, jotting down your brilliant ideas, recording your accomplishments, and more.
