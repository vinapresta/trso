Volume 1 begins with Spark's best-selling The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), whose Scottish schoolmistress remains one of the most memorable characters in modern fiction, and follows it with The Comforters, her first novel (1957), The Only Problem (1984), The Driver's Seat (1970), and Memento Mori (1959), a comic and macabre study of old age. Volume 2 continues with Loitering with Intent (1981), a fascinating story of how art and life imitate each other; The Girls of Slender Means (1963), whose resourceful young heroines of war-ravaged London are of Spark's own generation; The Abbess of Crewe (1973), the tale of a Watergate-style power struggle ingeniously set in a conven",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YxKoAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt",subtitle:c}},{id:10630,attributes:{title:e,description:"Muriel Spark's classic novel of the power of loyalty and influence now available in a stunning package that is accessible for all readers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=K5zdygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2020-02-15",publisher:"Dyslexia-Friendly Classics",subtitle:c}},{id:10631,attributes:{title:"The prime of Miss Jean Brodie",description:c,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xlE-PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1985-01-01",publisher:c,subtitle:c}},{id:10632,attributes:{title:e,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069472265}}("movie","Muriel Spark","","series","The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie",null,1,"“A perfect book”—and basis for the Maggie Smith film—about a teacher who makes a lasting impression on her female students in the years before World War II (Chicago Tribune). “Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life!” So asserts Jean Brodie, a magnetic, dubious, and sometimes comic teacher at the conservative Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh. Brodie selects six favorite pupils to mold—and she doesn’t stop with just their intellectual lives. She has a plan for them all, including how they will live, whom they will love, and what sacrifices they will make to uphold her ideals. When the girls reach adulthood and begin to find their own destinies, Jean Brodie’s indelible imprint is a gift to some, and a curse to others. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is Spark’s masterpiece, a novel that offers one of twentieth-century English literature’s most iconic and complex characters—a woman at once admirable and sinister, benevolent and conniving. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Muriel Spark including rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the author’s archive at the National Library of Scotland.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BFLMLH_XqngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2012-03-20","Open Road Media","A Novel"))
