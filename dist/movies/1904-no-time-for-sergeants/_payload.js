First published in 1954, it has been made into a Broadway Play, several Theatrical Productions, a movie and a long running television series, with several spin-offs. It started several now famous actors on their careers and established their personas for other movies and other TV shows. The story starts when the man from the draft board arrives in his car to take hillbilly Will Stockdale to Callville for induction into the army. Pa chases him off. But even hastily erected barbed wire couldn't prevent Uncle Sam from claiming a draftee and soon Will was off by bus to Ft. Thompson, Georgia. And there began as wildly improbable series of humorous episodes as anyone is likely to recall. In the barracks Will meets little Ben Whitledge. Together they managed to get assigned to the Air Force, even though Will couldn't understand \"Yankee Talk\" at first. His long hours at KP and as latrine orderly hardly prepared him for his interview with the psychiatrist or the gunners school or mock warfare.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_qPCrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[g],firstBook:f,published:"2014-12-07",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:9592,attributes:{title:c,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[e,g],firstBook:f,published:k,publisher:l,subtitle:m}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531326963}}("","movie","No Time for Sergeants","series","Ira Levin",null,"Mac Hyman",1,"THE STORY: NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS' central figure is a husky and good-natured hillbilly who finally gets into the Air Force despite his father's propensity for tearing up his draft papers.
