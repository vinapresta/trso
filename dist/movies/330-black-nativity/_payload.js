From the welding of their friendship in 1925 until Hughes's death in 1967, this volume gathers the best of the forty-two years of correspondence between them. The first letters, written in the midst of the Harlem Renaissance, witness the struggle of two young writers searching for a voice and an identity. By 1941, both Bontemps and Hughes had achieved a certain degree of success, and had become increasingly involved in racial and social struggles. Finally, in the period between 1959 and 1967, we see them react to the civil rights movement. This fascinating collection makes an invaluable contribution to the understanding of twentieth century American culture and one of its most vital components, the African-American heritage which these two correspondents did so much to create. --From book cover.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=LFVaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Arna Wendell Bontemps",b],firstBook:c,published:"1990-01-01",publisher:"Athena",subtitle:a}},{id:3110,attributes:{title:"The Collected Works of Langston Hughes: Essays on art, race, politics, and world affairs",description:h,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9JPL7qNp20wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,i,"Leslie Catherine Sanders",k,j,l,"Joseph McLaren","Dianne Johnson",m],firstBook:c,published:n,publisher:o,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940925848}}("","Langston Hughes",null,"Black Nativity","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=22SxKSDEgLcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1992-01-01","Dramatic Publishing","The sixteen volumes are published with the goal that Hughes pursued throughout his lifetime: making his books available to the people.
