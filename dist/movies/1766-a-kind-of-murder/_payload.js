Walter Stackhouse is rich, successful and unhappily married to the beautiful but damaged Clara. His desire to be free of her feeds his obsession with Kimmel, a man suspected of brutally murdering his own wife. But when Clara is found dead in suspicious circumstances, Walter's string of lies and his own guilty thoughts seem enough to condemn him. As his life becomes dangerously entwined with Kimmel's, a ruthless cop is increasingly convinced he has found a copycat killer in Walter and aims to nail both murderers.",slug:"a-kind-of-murder"}}},books:{data:[{id:9048,attributes:{title:d,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:e,subtitle:a}},{id:9049,attributes:{title:d,description:f,thumbnail:g,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:h,publisher:e,subtitle:a}},{id:9050,attributes:{title:"The Blunderer, Etc",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1958-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:9051,attributes:{title:"Carol (Movie Tie-in Edition)",description:"\"A great American writer…Highsmith's writing is wicked…it puts a spell on you.\" —Entertainment Weekly Now a major motion picture. Patricia Highsmith's story of romantic obsession may be one of the most important, but still largely unrecognized, novels of the twentieth century. First published in 1952 and touted as \"the novel of a love that society forbids,\" the book soon became a cult classic. Based on a true story plucked from Highsmith's own life, Carol tells the riveting drama of Therese Belivet, a stage designer trapped in a department-store day job, whose routine is forever shattered by a gorgeous epiphany—the appearance of Carol Aird, a customer who comes in to buy her daughter a Christmas toy. Therese begins to gravitate toward the alluring suburban housewife, who is trapped in a marriage as stultifying as Therese's job. They fall in love and set out across the United States, ensnared by society's confines and the imminent disapproval of others, yet propelled by their infatuation. Carol is a brilliantly written story that may surprise Highsmith fans and will delight those discovering her work. This authorized edition includes an afterword by Patricia Highsmith.

W.

She is distant and neurotic, and Walter finds himself harboring gruesome fantasies about her demise. When Clara's dead body turns up at the bottom of a cliff in a manner uncannily resembling the recent death of a woman named Helen Kimmel who was murdered by her husband, Walter finds himself under intense scrutiny. He commits several blunders that claim his career and his reputation, cost him his friends, and eventually threaten his life. The Blunderer examines the dark obsessions that lie beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary people. With unerring psychological insight, Patricia Highsmith portrays characters who cross the precarious line separating fantasy from reality.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=K2VufreSCNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2001-11-17"))
