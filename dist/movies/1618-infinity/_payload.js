This wonderment was reinforced through the efforts of his father. The only thing that mattered as much as science, and his family, was Arline, whom he met when they were both in school. But fate can often be cruel and Arline is found to be stricken by Tuberculosis. Undaunted, Richard studies the disease as he studies science in hopes of curing her. When her disease is in remission, they marry and he proceeds on to college where his studies and the war lead him to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project. While Richard is intrigued with the solution to the project, he is also concerned with the outcome and saddened with the failing health of Arline.",slug:"infinity"}}},books:{data:[{id:8399,attributes:{title:f,description:g,thumbnail:h,authors:[i],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:8400,attributes:{title:"\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\"",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Richard Feynman"],firstBook:c,published:"1992-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Adventures of a Curious Character: Richard P.

It almost makes you want to become a physicist\" (Science Digest). Richard P. Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. In this lively work that “can shatter the stereotype of the stuffy scientist” (Detroit Free Press), Feynman recounts his experiences trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets—and much more of an eyebrow-raising nature. In his stories, Feynman’s life shines through in all its eccentric glory—a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah. Included for this edition is a new introduction by Bill Gates.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_gA_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Richard P.
