Mansfield haunts the cockpits, bars and roads of the rural South in the early 1960s, adrift but always capable of nearly anything.

Cockfighter is the least likely pulp novel of these: it is a masterpiece, a portrait of silent, passionate masculinity set against the underbelly of the rural South of the early 1960s.
