National Book Award finalist, Iraq war veteran, novelist and poet Kevin Powers creates a deeply affecting portrait of a life shaped by war. Letter Composed During a Lull in the Fighting captures the many moments that comprise a soldier's life: driving down the Texas highway; waiting for the unknown in the dry Iraq heat; writing a love letter; listening to a mother recount her dreams. Written with evocative language and discernment, Powers's poetry strives to make sense of the war and its echoes through human experience. Just as The Yellow Birds was hailed as the \"first literary masterpiece produced by the Iraq war,\" this collection will make its mark as a powerful, enduring work (Los Angeles Times).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YI9cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2014-04-01",publisher:f,subtitle:"Poems"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568366420}}("Kevin Powers","movie","The Yellow Birds",null,"A Novel","Hachette UK","","series",1,"Finalist for the National Book Award, The Yellow Birds is the harrowing story of two young soldiers trying to stay alive in Iraq. \"The war tried to kill us in the spring.\" So begins this powerful account of friendship and loss.
