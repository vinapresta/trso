COMPANY MAN &quot;A high octane thrill ride!&quot; - San Francisco Chronicle on Paranoia Joseph Finder&#39;s New York Times bestseller Paranoia was hailed by critics as &quot;jet-propelled,&quot; the &quot;Page Turner of the Year,&quot; and &quot;the archetype of the thriller in its contemporary form.&quot; Now Finder returns with Company Man - a heart-stopping thriller about ambition, betrayal, and the price of secrets. Nick Conover is the CEO of a major corporation, a local boy made good, and once the most admired man in a company town. But that was before the layoffs. When a faceless stalker menaces his family, Nick, a single father of two since the recent death of his wife, finds that the gated community they live in is no protection at all. He decides to take action, a tragedy ensues - and immediately his life spirals out of control. At work, Nick begins to uncover a conspiracy against him, involving some of his closest colleagues. He doesn&#39;t know who he can trust - including the brilliant, troubled new woman in his life. Meanwhile, his actions are being probed by a homicide detective named Audrey Rhimes, a relentless investigator with a strong sense of morality - and her own, very personal reason for pursuing Nick Conover. With everything he cares about in the balance, Nick discovers strengths he never knew he had. His enemies don&#39;t realize how hard he&#39;ll fight to save his company. And nobody knows how far he&#39;ll go to protect his family.

He&#39;s a witty, charismatic guy who&#39;s well liked at the office, but he lacks the &quot;killer instinct&quot; necessary to move up the corporate ladder. To the chagrin of his ambitious wife, it looks as if his career has hit a ceiling. Jason&#39;s been sidelined. But all that will change one evening when Jason meets Kurt Semko, a former Special Forces officer just back from Iraq. Looking for a decent pitcher for the company softball team, Jason gets Kurt, who was once drafted by the majors, a job in Corporate Security. Soon, good things start to happen for Jasonâand bad things start to happen to Jason&#39;s rivals. His career suddenly takes off. He&#39;s an overnight success. Only too late does Jason discover that his friend Kurt has been secretly paving his path to the top by the most &quot;efficient&quot;âand ruthlessâ means available. After all, as Kurt says, &quot;Business is war, right?&quot; But when Jason tries to put a stop to it, he finds that his new best friend has become the most dangerous enemy imaginable. And now it&#39;s far more than just his career that lies in the balance. A riveting tale of ambition, intrigue, and the price of success, Killer Instinct is Joseph Finder at his best. *San Francisco Chronicle ** Pittsburgh Post Gazette</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjYwMTYwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA4NTc2OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Paranoia" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Paranoia is based on the book Paranoia? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">The high stakes thriller Paranoia takes us deep behind the scenes of global success to a deadly world of greed and deception.
