H R F Keating, a crime novelist and respected reviewer of crime fiction, brought together a dozen distinguished writers from both sides of the Atlantic to throw light on this double mystery. Some analyse the art itself; some explain the reasons for her success, not just the books, but also in film and theatre. The approaches are penetrating, affectionate, enthusiastic, analytical, funny - even critical. Together, they give an almost unique insight into the life and work of the First Lady of Crime.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2f7cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2020-10-01","Hachette UK"))
