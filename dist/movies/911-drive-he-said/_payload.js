Inevitably, there will be comparisons to Whitman and Sandburg...but CHICKEN ON CHURCH goes beyond them in its specificity of human detail, and its tremendous range of reference.

The comic tone protects the poem from grandiosity, but still, there is something grand here\"--Robert Charlton. Jeremy Larner won the Delta Prize for his first novel, Drive, He Said;worked as a speechwriter for Gene McCarthy in his presidential campaign, andwrote a book about it, Nobody Knows; won an Oscar for his originalscreenplay of \"The Candidate\"...and thinks CHICKEN ON CHURCH & OTHER POEMSis the best work he's ever done.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=C-NlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","2006-01-01"))
