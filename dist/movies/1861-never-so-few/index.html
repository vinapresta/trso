Until now. With the publication of Sinatra in Hollywood, an analytical yet deeply personal look at the screen legend of Frank Sinatra, Sinatra&#39;s standing as a significant, indeed legendary, screen actor has now been placed in full perspective. Examining each of Sinatra&#39;s seventy film appearances in depth, Tom Santopietro traces the arc of his astonishing six-decade run as a film actor, from his rise to stardom in &quot;boy next door&quot; musical films like Anchors Aweigh and On the Town, through his fall from grace with legendary flops like The Kissing Bandit, to the near-mythic comeback with his Oscar-winning performance in From Here to Eternity. Laced throughout with Sinatra&#39;s own observations on his film work, Sinatra in Hollywood deals head-on with his tumultuous marriages to Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and directly addresses the rumors of Mob involvement in Sinatra&#39;s Hollywood career. Ranging from the specifics of his controversial acting nickname of One Take Charlie to the iconic Rat Pack film Ocean&#39;s Eleven, from the groundbreaking performance in The Manchurian Candidate to the moving and elegiac late-career roles as tough yet vulnerable detectives, the myths and personal foibles are stripped away, placing the focus squarely on the work. Oftentimes brilliant, occasionally off-kilter, but always compelling, Frank Sinatra, the film icon who registered as nothing less than emblematic of &quot;The American Century,&quot; here receives his full due as the serious artist he was, the actor about whom director Billy Wilder emphatically stated, &quot;Frank Sinatra is beyond talent.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9443"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zkRvCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Go Naked In The World" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Go Naked In The World</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Tom T.

In quiet rebellion, his beautiful wife, Mary, becomes a secret drinker; his daughter, Yvonne, learns about life behind her father’s back. Only his son, Nick, a battle-scarred veteran of twenty-three, dares openly to defy his father. This is the backdrop for Tom T. Chamales’ extraordinary new novel. With power and humor, the bestselling author of Never So Few charts the rebellion of a son against the tyranny of his father and the shallow confines of a wealthy world. The conflict reaches a shattering climax when Nick falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Nora, and Old Pete determines to regain control of Nick’s future by revealing that the woman his son loves is the town’s highest priced call girl.... “A work marked by this writer’s passion and vividness....The novel carries us along with its compelling intensity.”—Los Angeles Times “A vivid, believable story...peopled with wonderful characters.”—Newark News “This is a big novel, almost any way you look at it—powerfully and luridly written—and a remarkable story of a passionate, hard-living Greek-American family in Chicago.”—Boston Sun Herald</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE1OTM5ZTItMTgzZS00OGE4LWJiODAtNGVlMmNkY2UwMWM4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Never So Few" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Never So Few is based on the book Never So Few? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Captain Tom Reynolds and his band of skilled OSS operatives are in WWII Burma to arm and train the Kachin natives.
