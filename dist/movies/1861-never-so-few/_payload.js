Until now. With the publication of Sinatra in Hollywood, an analytical yet deeply personal look at the screen legend of Frank Sinatra, Sinatra's standing as a significant, indeed legendary, screen actor has now been placed in full perspective. Examining each of Sinatra's seventy film appearances in depth, Tom Santopietro traces the arc of his astonishing six-decade run as a film actor, from his rise to stardom in \"boy next door\" musical films like Anchors Aweigh and On the Town, through his fall from grace with legendary flops like The Kissing Bandit, to the near-mythic comeback with his Oscar-winning performance in From Here to Eternity. Laced throughout with Sinatra's own observations on his film work, Sinatra in Hollywood deals head-on with his tumultuous marriages to Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and directly addresses the rumors of Mob involvement in Sinatra's Hollywood career. Ranging from the specifics of his controversial acting nickname of One Take Charlie to the iconic Rat Pack film Ocean's Eleven, from the groundbreaking performance in The Manchurian Candidate to the moving and elegiac late-career roles as tough yet vulnerable detectives, the myths and personal foibles are stripped away, placing the focus squarely on the work. Oftentimes brilliant, occasionally off-kilter, but always compelling, Frank Sinatra, the film icon who registered as nothing less than emblematic of \"The American Century,\" here receives his full due as the serious artist he was, the actor about whom director Billy Wilder emphatically stated, \"Frank Sinatra is beyond talent.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=el-U8apn90UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Tom Santopietro"],firstBook:d,published:"2009-11-10",publisher:"Macmillan",subtitle:"The Film Career of a Screen Icon"}},{id:9443,attributes:{title:"Go Naked In The World",description:"A House Divided Old Pete Stratton, a theater tycoon with some shadily earned millions, is a shrewd, tough patriarch who dominates and dictates the lives of his family. In quiet rebellion, his beautiful wife, Mary, becomes a secret drinker; his daughter, Yvonne, learns about life behind her father’s back. Only his son, Nick, a battle-scarred veteran of twenty-three, dares openly to defy his father. This is the backdrop for Tom T. Chamales’ extraordinary new novel. With power and humor, the bestselling author of Never So Few charts the rebellion of a son against the tyranny of his father and the shallow confines of a wealthy world. The conflict reaches a shattering climax when Nick falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Nora, and Old Pete determines to regain control of Nick’s future by revealing that the woman his son loves is the town’s highest priced call girl.... “A work marked by this writer’s passion and vividness....The novel carries us along with its compelling intensity.”—Los Angeles Times “A vivid, believable story...peopled with wonderful characters.”—Newark News “This is a big novel, almost any way you look at it—powerfully and luridly written—and a remarkable story of a passionate, hard-living Greek-American family in Chicago.”—Boston Sun Herald",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=zkRvCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2015-11-06",publisher:"Pickle Partners Publishing",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940955550}}("","Never So Few","Tom T.

American soldiers and native Kachin troops battle Japanese forces behind enemy lines in the Burmese jungles. But during the brutal campaign to gain territory in the unforgiving tropical landscape, Captain Reynolds and his band of special operations soldiers and guerrilla fighters struggle to find self-awareness, and even love, in the midst of the trials of combat. One of the youngest officers to serve in Merrill’s Marauders and OSS Detachment 101—precursors to the Green Berets and Central Intelligence Agency—author Tom T. Chamales brings an unparalleled level of authentic detail and raw intensity to this work of fiction based on his real-life experience in the jungles of Southeast Asia. Never So Few is “an extraordinary and powerful book,” unflinching in its portrayal of wartime sacrifice and violence (Kirkus Reviews, starred). The basis for the movie starring Frank Sinatra and Steve McQueen, it offers “dramatic, exciting, and concretely detailed accounts of battle action,” and joins the ranks of other classic war novels such as From Here to Eternity and The Naked and the Dead in bringing later generations to the frontlines and into the inner lives of the brave men who served (The New York Times).","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=W8QjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2017-07-25","Open Road Media","A Novel"))
