Once out of prison, at the request of his crime boss \"Big Mac\", Roy agrees to pull one more heist before retiring. His target is a fancy mountain resort hotel where employee Louis Mendoza is Roy's \"inside man\". Roy Earle's team of robbers include hotheaded Babe, Red, and dance-hall girl Marie who falls for Roy, but he only thinks of innocent young Velma, whom he recently met. Velma has a slight foot handicap and smitten Roy plans to pay for her surgery with his share of the loot.

You won't be able to look away until the bitter end as the motley gang prepares for, and then carries out, the heist, and as this easy \"knockover\" begins to fall apart due to bad luck and a series of blunders by the main characters. The story is enhanced by the warring impulses that torment Roy Earle, who longs desperately for his tranquil, rural roots, but who has spent too much of his life among thugs and killers to ever be completely normal again. Written by W.R. Burnett, the author of Little Caesar and Asphalt Jungle and one of the most important chroniclers of the American criminal class in the early twentieth century, the Gutter Books edition is complete with a new forward and a fun glossary of the gangster terminology used in the book.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UUWTMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["W.
