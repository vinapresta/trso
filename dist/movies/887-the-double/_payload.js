It is the story of Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, a government clerk who believes that a fellow clerk has taken over his identity and is determined to bring about his ruin. Considered the most Gogolesque of Dostoyevsky's works, the novella brilliantly depicts Golyadkin's descent into madness in a way that is hauntingly poetic. \"The Double\" illustrates Dostoyevsky's uncanny ability at capturing the complexity of human emotion especially the darker side of the human psyche.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ZlQ3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky"],firstBook:c,published:"2021-07-19",publisher:"Phoemixx Classics Ebooks",subtitle:a}},{id:5405,attributes:{title:"The Double by Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)",description:"This eBook features the unabridged text of ‘The Double’ from the bestselling edition of ‘The Complete Works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’.

Never afterwards was he so fully and openly to reveal the inmost recesses, unmeant for display, of his heart.' 'The Double' (1846) is the nightmarish story of Mr Golyadkin, a man who is haunted or possessed by his own double. Is 'Mr Golyadkinjunior' really a double or simply a fearful side of his own nature?
