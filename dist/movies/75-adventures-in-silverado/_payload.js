During the race, Foss's coach is forced off the road and his best team-horse is injured. Doctor Henderson (Edgar Buchanan), noted for his philanthropies to the local miners, advises Foss he can't run his horse for some time to come, and Foss takes a job with Jeannie, hauling water to Squatter's Flats, a desert waste which requires irrigation. Later, Zeke, carrying gold from Last Dog Ditch Mine to Silverado is robbed by a mysterious bandit called The Monk,and he suspects Foss.

Stevenson then described his travels on Silverado Squatters.In Calistoga, Robert Louis Stevenson uses a telephone for the first time. Also visit a petrified forest and taste Napa Valley wine. In his travels in the region, Robert Louis Stevenson meets a variety of interesting characters: other Scots abroad, for example, and Mr. Kelmar, who is totally concerned with making money.In Silverado Squatters, Robert Louis Stevenson returns again and again to issues of national identity; he is concerned about what it means for his sense of self to leave his homeland behind: \"I wrote that a man belonged these days to a variety of countries; but the old land is still true love, the others are pleasant infidelities. Scotland is indefinable; it has no unit except on the map \". In fact, despite finding California beautiful, Robert Louis Stevenson often feels a deep nostalgia for Scotland and Edinburgh in particular: \"There are no stars as beautiful as the street lamps in Edinburgh.
