Then as he gets deeper into the case, Everett realises there&#39;s a chance Beachum is the wrong man on the gurney, but with just hours to go before the lethal injection Everett has literally no time to lose if he&#39;s to find out if Beachum deserves to die. MAN AND WIFE - Cal Bradley runs a highly-respected psychiatric clinic in New England. He was brought up in the town and has followed his father&#39;s footsteps in being a philanthropic citizen. He is living the American dream. Then he agrees to give free treatment to a badly disturbed young man who is suspected of murder. As Cal sets out to prove Peter&#39;s innocence and get him released, he discovers the murdered man is not such a stranger, but if he exposes the identity of the real killer the truth will destroy him.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12808"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=SWNPxwTPaAoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book True Crime" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>True Crime</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Andrew Klavan<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Dell</span><span><span> - </span>4/27/2011</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>In the heat of the city, a man is out of time: speeding in a beat-up Ford Tempo, blasting easy-listening music.

Richard Storm is a Hollywood producer who has reached the top of his profession making horror movies based on classic English ghost stories. Now, with his life beginning to unravel, he flees to England on a desperate quest: to find evidence that the great old stories bear an element of truth, that the human spirit lives on after death, that in this all-too-material world there still may be reason to have faith. But his search uncovers more than he bargained for: Sophia Endering, a mysterious damsel in distress who may just be the last love of Storm&#39;s life; Harper Albright, an eccentric pipe-smoking old woman whose researches into the paranormal mask an obsessive hunt for a malevolent killer; and the man known as Saint Iago, a seemingly immortal villain who makes a night with a vampire look like a walk in the park. Richard Storm&#39;s nightmares are about to step down off the screen into real life. And Storm is about to begin a journey through his deepest passions and his darkest fears, to a romance that could last forever, and a secret a thousand years old-down a trail formed by the classic ghost stories themselves-into the very heart of the uncanny.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12810"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zc53BDloUIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Dynamite Road" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Dynamite Road</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Andrew Klavan<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Forge Books</span><span><span> - </span>8/1/2004</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Jim Bishop is a hard man, as cold as the wind off the water and tough to the point of brutality. Scott Weiss is Bishop&#39;s boss, a world-weary ex-cop who runs a private detective agency out of a concrete tower in the heart of San Francisco. In this powerfully original series debut by award-winning and bestselling author Andrew Klavan, Weiss sends Bishop to investigate corruption at a Northern California airport-and so sets events in motion that will lead both men on a desperate hunt for a master assassin. Bishop&#39;s assignment is to investigate the airport and report back to Weiss. But Bishop prefers to make up the rules as he goes along. He&#39;s willing to beat any man into the ground and draw any woman into his bed in order to get the answers he&#39;s after. A pilot himself, he takes to the air to check out the illegal flights of a thug names Chris Wannamaker. Then he coolly seduces Wannamaker&#39;s lonely wife in order to find out more. Back in the city, as Weiss struggles to rein Bishop in, he begins a connected investigation of his own. A death in a mansion in Presidio Heights, a seemingly random murder South of Market, an apparent suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge, all seem to bear the mark of Weiss&#39; old nemesis, an expert gun-for-hire who goes by the name of the Shadowman. It&#39;s a trail of blood, and each step of it seems to bring Weiss closer to Julie Wyant, a mysterious beauty who captures the imagination of every man she meets. Soon Bishop has found his way into the center of a massive criminal conspiracy, a plan set to climax with an act of audacious violence and a murder that would be impossible for any killer but one. And with his operative&#39;s wife in danger, Weiss begins a race against time to outsmart the murderer who stalks his nightmares and to rescue the woman who haunts his dream. If you like your tough guys really tough, your femme fatale and your action explosive-welcome to Dynamite Road.
