On its publication in France, this brilliant novel was awarded the Prix Ste. Beuve. Since its appearance in the USA and its presentation as a film, this compelling story has been awarded a succession of prizes in both the fields of entertainment and literature. This is a historical novel. It is based in part on factual events. It was made into the greatest movie ever made. Although hard to believe, the book is based on actual real historical events, except that vastly more people died building the real bridge and the railroad to the bridge than are shown in the movie.
