A troubled US army lieutenant has confessed to murdering a British officer, and Captain Adams has been assigned as his defense attorney. Military court officials want the cleanest possible trial for the lieutenant, and they believe that Captain Adams, a war hero and distinguished lawyer, is the best man for the job. But when Adams begins to investigate the murder, he finds that this seemingly open-and-shut case is actually much more complicated. Before long he is absorbed in a dramatic struggle for a fair trial against the most overwhelming odds. Thrilling and thought-provoking, The Winston Affair is a powerful portrait of a man torn between the wishes of his superiors and the call for justice. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Howard Fast including rare photos from the author’s estate.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-hkO_UnXjnwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-12-13","Open Road Media","A Novel"))
