Scott Fitzgerald introduces the reader to the post-war America and offers a gripping social commentary on the themes of power, crime, betrayal, greed and a vivid peek into the American life in the 1920s, also known as the âRoaring Twentiesâ. In the summer of 1922, Nick Carraway arrives in New York in pursuit of the big American dream. Nick, the storyâs narrator, moves in next door to the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, the host of lavish weekly parties for the rich and the fashionable. Across the bay reside Nickâs distant cousin Daisy and her philandering husband, Tom, an old classmate from Yale. Being the only link between Gatsby and his long lost love, Nick gets drawn into the enthralling world of the rich and takes the reader along on the ride, as he bears witness to their follies and emerges a new enlightened man.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb7120"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=HVFnDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Originals: The Great Gatsby" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Originals: The Great Gatsby</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->F.

Scott Fitzgeraldâs The Great Gatsby was first published in 1925. An exploration of a variety of themesâartistic and cultural dynamism, evolution of jazz music, economic prosperity, organised crime culture, technologies in communicationâThe Great Gatsby, is a reflection of the Roaring Twenties, often described as a cautionary tale of the âAmerican Dreamâ. In the summer of 1922, Jay Gatsby, a young and enigmatic millionaire falls in love with Daisy Fay Buchanan. Nick Carraway, a veteran of the Great War from the Midwest (and Daisy Fay Buchananâs cousin), rents a small house on Long Island, next to Jay Gatsbyâs opulent mansion where he throws extravagant parties. A series of extraordinary events unfold and Fitzgerald presents a critical social history of America through his unusual characters. The initial response to The Great Gatsby was mixed and the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died thinking himself to be a failed writer. His work came into prominence during World War II and The Great Gatsby joined the ranks of the worldâs leading classics. A satirical exposÃ© of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby is a must-read for literature lovers.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb7121"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=5yA8MQAACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Great Gatsby" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Great Gatsby</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->F.

People were not invited - they went there.&#39; Jay Gatsby&#39;s opulent Long Island mansion throngs with the bright young things of the Roaring Twenties. But Gatsby himself, young, handsome and mysteriously rich, never appears to his guests. He stands apart from the crowd, yearning for something just out of reach - Daisy Buchanan, lost years before to another man. One fateful summer, when the pair finally reunite, their actions set in motion a series of events that will unravel their lives, bringing tragedy to all who surround them. Widely considered F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s masterpiece, The Great Gatsby is a tale of excess and obsession, and a work of classic twentieth-century American literature.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjllODg0ZGYtYzE1OS00ZTc3LThmYjYtMjg0ZDM3ODlhZjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcxMDI2MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster The Great Gatsby" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie The Great Gatsby is based on the book The Great Gatsby? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Nick Carraway, a young Midwesterner now living on Long Island, finds himself fascinated by the mysterious past and lavish lifetyle of his landlord, the nouveau riche Jay Gatsby.
