It was nothing more than a one-night stand. Juliana Brody, a judge in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, is rumored to be in consideration for the federal circuit, maybe someday the highest court in the land. At a conference in a Chicago hotel, she meets a gentle, vulnerable man and has an unforgettable night with him—something she’d never done before. They part with an explicit understanding that this must never happen again. But back home in Boston, Juliana realizes that this was no random encounter. The man from Chicago proves to have an integral role in a case she&#39;s presiding over--a sex-discrimination case that&#39;s received national attention. Juliana discovers that she&#39;s been entrapped, her night of infidelity captured on video. Strings are being pulled in high places, a terrifying unfolding conspiracy that will turn her life upside down. But soon it becomes clear that personal humiliation, even the possible destruction of her career, are the least of her concerns, as her own life and the lives of her family are put in mortal jeopardy. In the end, turning the tables on her adversaries will require her to be as ruthless as they are.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb7628"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=VGcyN4-Na8QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Paranoia and Company Man" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Paranoia and Company Man</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Joseph Finder<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by St. Martin&#39;s Griffin</span><span><span> - </span>9/5/2006</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>From the New York Times bestselling author Joseph Finder comes two thrilling novels in a discounted ebook bundle, Paranoia and Company Man PARANOIA Adam Cassidy is twenty-six and a low level employee at a high-tech corporation who hates his job. When he manipulates the system to do something nice for a friend, he finds himself charged with a crime. Corporate Security gives him a choice: prison - or become a spy in the headquarters of their chief competitor, Trion Systems. They train him. They feed him inside information. Now, at Trion, he&#39;s a star, skyrocketing to the top. He finds he has talents he never knew he possessed. He&#39;s rich, drives a Porsche, lives in a fabulous apartment, and works directly for the CEO. He&#39;s dating the girl of his dreams. His life is perfect. And all he has to do to keep it that way is betray everyone he cares about and everything he believes in. But when he tries to break off from his controllers, he finds he&#39;s in way over his head, trapped in a world in which nothing is as it seems and no one can really be trusted. And then the real nightmare begins... From the writer whose novels have been called &quot;thrilling&quot; (New York Times) and &quot;dazzling&quot; (USA Today) comes an electrifying new novel, a roller-coaster ride of suspense that will hold the reader hostage until the final, astonishing twist. COMPANY MAN &quot;A high octane thrill ride!&quot; - San Francisco Chronicle on Paranoia Joseph Finder&#39;s New York Times bestseller Paranoia was hailed by critics as &quot;jet-propelled,&quot; the &quot;Page Turner of the Year,&quot; and &quot;the archetype of the thriller in its contemporary form.&quot; Now Finder returns with Company Man - a heart-stopping thriller about ambition, betrayal, and the price of secrets. Nick Conover is the CEO of a major corporation, a local boy made good, and once the most admired man in a company town. But that was before the layoffs. When a faceless stalker menaces his family, Nick, a single father of two since the recent death of his wife, finds that the gated community they live in is no protection at all. He decides to take action, a tragedy ensues - and immediately his life spirals out of control. At work, Nick begins to uncover a conspiracy against him, involving some of his closest colleagues. He doesn&#39;t know who he can trust - including the brilliant, troubled new woman in his life. Meanwhile, his actions are being probed by a homicide detective named Audrey Rhimes, a relentless investigator with a strong sense of morality - and her own, very personal reason for pursuing Nick Conover. With everything he cares about in the balance, Nick discovers strengths he never knew he had. His enemies don&#39;t realize how hard he&#39;ll fight to save his company. And nobody knows how far he&#39;ll go to protect his family. Mesmerizing and psychologically astute, Company Man is Joseph Finder&#39;s most compelling and original novel yet.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb7629"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=UfYfVXtZ6R0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Killer Instinct" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Killer Instinct</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Joseph Finder<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by St. Martin&#39;s Press</span><span><span> - </span>4/1/2007</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Jason Steadman is a thirty-year-old sales executive living in Boston and working for an electronics giant, a competitor to Sony and Panasonic. He&#39;s a witty, charismatic guy who&#39;s well liked at the office, but he lacks the &quot;killer instinct&quot; necessary to move up the corporate ladder. To the chagrin of his ambitious wife, it looks as if his career has hit a ceiling. Jason&#39;s been sidelined. But all that will change one evening when Jason meets Kurt Semko, a former Special Forces officer just back from Iraq. Looking for a decent pitcher for the company softball team, Jason gets Kurt, who was once drafted by the majors, a job in Corporate Security. Soon, good things start to happen for Jason—and bad things start to happen to Jason&#39;s rivals. His career suddenly takes off. He&#39;s an overnight success. Only too late does Jason discover that his friend Kurt has been secretly paving his path to the top by the most &quot;efficient&quot;—and ruthless— means available. After all, as Kurt says, &quot;Business is war, right?&quot; But when Jason tries to put a stop to it, he finds that his new best friend has become the most dangerous enemy imaginable. And now it&#39;s far more than just his career that lies in the balance.
