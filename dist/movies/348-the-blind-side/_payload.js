Greed and excess defined the 1980s, and the sports world was no exception. Shifting from the love of the game to the love of money, athletes made the transition from representing honor and humility to becoming brash and branded. Capturing the stories of headliners who capitalized on this trend, Bigger Than the Game charts the rise (and sometimes spectacular fall) of four athletes over the span of one of the most dramatic eras in sports. Meticulously researched, with stirring, you-are-there reporting, Bigger Than the Game assembles a cast that includes Jim McMahon, who took the Chicago Bears to Super Bowl glory despite his penchant for partying and his aversion to following the game plan; Brian Boswoth, the university of Oklahoma linebacker who mugged for the cameras while calling the NCAA a communist organization; Bo Jackson, who pursued promising careers in both pro football and baseball; and Len Bias, poised to ensure the Boston Celtics' dominance but died of a cocaine overdose just one day after the draft. Also packed with portraits of folk heroes such as \"Refrigerator\" Perry and Michael Jordan, Bigger Than the Game offers a riveting ride for every sports fan.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=r6zlwKAQJNgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Michael Weinreb"],firstBook:d,published:"2010-08-05",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:"Bo, Boz, the Punky QB, and How the '80s Created the Celebrity Athlete"}},{id:3195,attributes:{title:g,description:"Biography, autobiography, and memoir is among the best ways to teach students to appreciate nonfiction reading.",thumbnail:c,authors:[e],firstBook:d,published:"2009-01-01",publisher:"Everbind",subtitle:"Evolution of a Game"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531278481}}("movie","series","",null,"Michael Lewis",1,"The Blind Side","The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game","\"Lewis has such a gift for storytelling... he writes as lucidly for sports fans as for those who read him for other reasons.\"--Janet Maslin, New York Times When we first meet Michael Oher is one of thirteen children by a mother addicted to crack; he does not know his real name, his father, his birthday, or how to read or write. He takes up football, and school, after a rich, white, Evangelical family plucks him from the streets. Then two great forces alter Oher: the family's love and the evolution of professional football itself into a game in which the quarterback must be protected at any cost.
