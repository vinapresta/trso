Someone has been cashing counterfeit tickets at the local greyhound track, taking the owners for thousands of dollars every night, and Mayme Martin, resident of the Red Rose Apartments, has an idea about who’s responsible. But drunk and haggard, she won’t be able to tell Shayne everything he needs to know in time.

A year after marrying the toughest PI in Miami, Phyllis Shayne longs for a few weeks alone with her husband. She and Mike are about to board a train to New York when a client shows up at the door. Her face gray and her voice slurred, the mysterious woman passes out before she’s able to get through her story. Mike carries the stranger to his spare bedroom and, trying to save his wife from worry, tells Phyllis to go on to the train station without him; he’ll meet her in a few days. When he goes back to check on the woman, she is dead, with one of her stockings wrapped tightly around her throat. Something is fishy, but it’s about to get far more complicated when the body disappears. The woman arrived just after Mike took a call from Sam Marsh, a close friend who’s in a mayoral race that’s about to turn bloody. To save his friend’s campaign and keep himself out of jail, Mike will have to find the killer—but he’ll have to find the body first. Bodies Are Where You Find Them is the 5th book in the Mike Shayne Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SeCxCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
