Ironweed, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is the best-known of William Kennedy&#39;s three Albany-based novels. Francis Phelan, ex-ballplayer, part-time gravedigger, full-time drunk, has hit bottom. Years ago he left Albany in a hurry after killing a scab during a trolley workers&#39; strike; he ran away again after accidentally - and fatally - dropping his infant son. Now, in 1938, Francis is back in town, roaming the old familiar streets with his hobo pal, Helen, trying to make peace with the ghosts of the past and the present.

The twenty-four interviews in this collection reveal how the opportunities and challenges in Kennedy&#39;s writing life parallel those other contemporary writers have faced in the last years of the century.The high drama of imagined worlds, he says, becomes a Rosetta Stone, the key that unlocks the very real mysteries and complexities of our daily lives.You&#39;re inventing out of a confluence of known facts and random ideas, he says about the process of writing, juxtaposing reality and abstractions, and then wham! You&#39;ve got something brand new in your head, and on the page. You&#39;re functioning on a plane of existence you didn&#39;t know was possible. That&#39;s creation, and it&#39;s profound pleasure. It&#39;s what you live for.Readers of these interviews will be privy to another process as well, the arduous but exciting process by which Kennedy has emerged as a major voice in contemporary letters. His meteoric rise to fame in 1983 and his continuing popularity since are the stuff of drama and folklore. In that year his novel Ironweed, rejected earlier by thirteen publishers, was finally published by Viking. It earned him a MacArthur Award, the New York Book Critics Circle Award, and a Pulitzer Prize. Governor Mario Cuomo honored him with the New York State Governor&#39;s Arts Award and declared that in Kennedy Albany (had) found its Homer. Hollywood came calling and secured screen rights to Ironweed, Legs, and Billy Phelan&#39;s Greatest Game. With Francis Ford Coppola, Kennedy co-wrote thescreenplay of The Cotton Club.The career that lifted off with such dramatic momentum has shown no signs of flagging. With steady regularity, Kennedy continues to add to his Albany Cycle of novels, as he experiments boldly with the craft of fiction.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb8575"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2QUPAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book An Albany Trio" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>An Albany Trio</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->William Kennedy<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Penguin Books</span><span><span> - </span>7/1/1996</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Presents three separate novels that follows the individual characters through the dark streets of Albany, New York during the 1920s and 1930s.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgyMmExYmEtOGM0NC00MjU3LTg4M2QtODRmNWM2NDgzMGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Ironweed" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Ironweed is based on the book Ironweed? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Albany, New York, Halloween, 1938. Francis Phelan and Helen Archer are bums, back in their birth city. She was a singer on the radio, he a major league pitcher. Death surrounds them: she&#39;s sick, a pal has cancer, he digs graves at the cemetery and visits the grave of his infant son whom he dropped; visions of his past haunt him, including ghosts of two men he killed. That night, out drinking, Helen tries to sing at a bar. Next day, Fran visits his wife and children and meets a grandson. He could stay, but decides it&#39;s not for him. Helen gets their things out of storage and finds a hotel. Amidst their mistakes and dereliction, the film explores their code of fairness and loyalty.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">6.7/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">58%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">56/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Ironweed, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
