Palo Alto is the debut of a surprising and powerful new literary voice. Written with an immediate sense of place--claustrophobic and ominous--James Franco's collection traces the lives of an extended group of teenagers as they experiment with vices of all kinds, struggle with their families and one another, and succumb to self-destructive, often heartless nihilism. In \"Lockheed\" a young woman's summer--spent working a dull internship--is suddenly upended by a spectacular incident of violence at a house party. In \"American History\" a high school freshman attempts to impress a girl during a classroom skit with a realistic portrayal of a slave ownerâ€”only to have his feigned bigotry avenged. In \"I Could Kill Someone,\" a lonely teenager buys a gun with the aim of killing his high school tormentor, but begins to wonder about his bully's own inner life. These linked stories, stark, vivid, and disturbing, are a compelling portrait of lives on the rough fringes of youth.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lzGWvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:"2010-10-19",publisher:"Simon & Schuster Audio",subtitle:f}},{id:10037,attributes:{title:c,description:"From acclaimed Hollywood actor\u002Fdirector James Franco comes a stunning work of fiction - the coming-of-age of a whole generation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2WkOKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2011-01-01",publisher:"Faber & Faber Limited",subtitle:f}},{id:10038,attributes:{title:c,description:"A collection of stories about troubled California teens and misfits follows the misadventures of a band of youths who experiment with vice in such tales as \"American History\" and \"I Could Kill Someone.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_wd_AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2014-05-06",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:f}},{id:10039,attributes:{title:"Palo Alto : Stories",description:e,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VJ10rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2012-01-01",publisher:e,subtitle:e}},{id:10040,attributes:{title:"Actors Anonymous",description:"A darkly comic tale by the actor, artist and author of Pao Alto is told in the style of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step testimonials, scripts, letters, diary entries and other forms that explore the nature and purpose of acting while sharing moving and satirical portraits of actors who did not achieve fame.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vSCqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2013-01-01",publisher:"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt",subtitle:e}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703519144}}("James Franco","movie","Palo Alto",null,"","Stories","series",1))
