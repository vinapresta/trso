They both work in the construction industry, and are devoted to each other and their collective families in doing what they see best for this collective. Although some of the manifestations are \"above the surface\", there are many problems within their families bubbling underneath the surface. Tommy and his wife Maria's youngest son, adolescent Albert, has stopped eating, with Tommy and Maria and the family not understanding or taking ownership of his anorexia, anxiety within their family collective the cause. Their oldest son Tommy Jr., nicknamed Stony, has recently graduated from high school and thus has to figure out what to do with his life. His father and uncle's mentality has been inbred into him, and as such he has been dating a loose girl named Cheri since he is not yet at the stage of settling down. However, Stony doesn't want to be an electrician like his father which is what is expected of him, but wants to work with kids in some aspect. A sympathetic doctor offers him a job working at the hospital as a children's recreational assistant in part so that he can test the waters. Stony not following in his father's footsteps does not sit well with Tommy, especially as he sees working with kids a woman's job. Stony has to figure out how to reconcile the fact that he still loves his parents yet does not want to end up like them, which is what will happen if he follows Tommy's predestined life for him. Stony may get a better picture of what to do through the support of his new girlfriend Annette, who has gone through growing up experiences of her own to get a good picture of who she truly is as a person.",slug:"bloodbrothers"}}},books:{data:[{id:3251,attributes:{title:d,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:b}},{id:3252,attributes:{title:d,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:b}},{id:3253,attributes:{title:"The Whites",description:"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER FINALIST FOR THE L.A. TIMES BOOK PRIZE 2015 IN THE MYSTERY\u002FTHRILLER CATEGORY Every cop has a personal 'White': a criminal who got away with murder – or worse – and was able to slip back into life, leaving the victim's family still seeking justice, the cop plagued by guilt. Back in the 1990s, Billy Graves was one of the Wild Geese: a tight-knit crew of young mavericks, fresh to police work and hungry for justice, looking out for each other and their 'family' of neighbourhood locals. But then Billy made some bad headlines by accidentally shooting a ten-year-old boy while bringing down an angel-dusted berserker in the street. Branded a loose cannon, he spent years in one dead-end posting after another. Now he has settled into his role as sergeant in the Night Watch, content simply to do his job and go home to his family. But when he is called to the 4 a.m. stabbing of a man in Penn Station, Billy discovers the victim is the 'White' of one of his oldest friends, a former member of the Wild Geese, who is now retired. As the past comes crashing into the present, the Wild Geese seemingly rise from the dead, and the bad old run-and-gun days of the 90s are back with a vengeance.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QyrbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Harry Brandt",a],firstBook:c,published:"2015-02-12",publisher:"Bloomsbury Publishing",subtitle:b}},{id:3254,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:l,publisher:m,subtitle:b}},{id:3255,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:l,publisher:m,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940927208}}("Richard Price","",null,"Bloodbrothers","Eighteen-year-old Stony De Coco, expected to fulfill his father's dream by joining the electrician's union, longs for escape but feels trapped by his obligations to his working-class family.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vGyso-ZuX1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1999-01-01","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","Lush Life","'So, what do you do?' Whenever people asked him, Eric Cash used to have a dozen answers. Artist, actor, screenwriter . . . But now he's thirty-five years old and he's still living on the Lower East Side, still in the restaurant business, still serving the people he wanted to be. What does Eric do? He manages. Not like Ike Marcus. Ike was young, good-looking, people liked him. Ask him what he did, he wouldn't say tending bar. He was going places-until two street kids stepped up to him and Eric one night and pulled a gun. At least, that's Eric's version. In Lush Life, Richard Price tears the shiny veneer off the 'new' New York to show us the hidden cracks, the underground networks of control and violence beneath the glamour. Lush Life is an X-ray of the street in the age of no broken windows and 'quality of life' squads, from a writer whose \"tough, gritty brand of social realism . . . reads like a movie in prose' Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=S1MQszenPeMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2009-09-07","A&C Black"))
