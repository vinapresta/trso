Douglas can be seen as a prequel to his best-seller \"The Robe\". It describes how it would be to follow Jesus as a disciple in his time. The book is an amazing work of inspirational historical fiction. The book is a christian fiction novel The kindle ebook can be formated the way you want (text sizes can be changed) The book consists of about 600 pages The book has lots of quite interesting characters - some historical and others fictional. All people in \"The Big Fisherman\", however, are impacted in some way through knowing of Jesus and his teaching. The story of \"The Big Fisherman\" The book chronicles the ministry of Jesus from His calling of the first inauspicious Apostles to the Church that rose and grew so rapidly in the first few years following His death, resurrection, and withdrawal from the world. We see these events unfold through the eyes of Simon, known to history as St. Peter, the Big Fisherman himself, who was such a majestic and comforting presence in The Robe. He shares point-of-view duties with Fara\u002FEsther, the apparently fictional daughter of Herod Antipas and Phasaelis (called Arnon in the novel) an Arabian princess whom he was forced to marry for political reasons and divorced in favor of his older sister-in-law Herodias. Of the two protagonists, Fara has the more adventurous life. At age twelve, she swore to avenge her mother's honor, and when her mother dies young of a mysterious illness four years later, the girl takes off for Judaea, disguised as a boy for her safety, aiming to assassinate her faithless father. Near the start of her quest, she runs into John the Baptist, finding him sympathetic and inspiring but frightened by his vision of the future. She is followed after several months by her boyfriend, Voldi, who becomes friends with the Roman Mencius (who also appears in The Robe) and both become embroiled in the events of Passion Week, but neither to the same extent as Peter or Fara. Peter, born Simon, is just a fisherman of Capernaum with little education and no use for religion. He hears of an itinerant preacher with apparently magical healing powers from his young friend John, son of Zebedee. Annoyed that someone has taken John's attention away from his job fishing, Peter storms off to one of Jesus' sermons, and witnesses the Man of Galilee give eyesight to a toddler who was clearly blind before. His whole worldview shaken, Simon spends the next several weeks irritable and depressed. Meanwhile, Fara, under the alias Esther, seeks refuge in Simon's mother-in-law's house, and gets a day job as a maid at Antipas' palace, where she hopes to eventually carry out her oath. Jesus calls Simon to follow him, and the miserable man only feels right in the presence of the Carpenter, so he obeys Him. His brother Andrew and his friends James and John soon join them. As Jesus travels across the country, trailing miracles in His wake, His following swells. After Jesus heals Simon's mother-in-law with Fara as witness, He convinces her to follow Him, and she does. The character development for Simon\u002FPeter is so good that he seems ready to step off the page by the end.",thumbnail:a,authors:[f],firstBook:e,published:"2021-03-11",publisher:a,subtitle:"The Life of Peter, One of the Closest Disciples of Jesus Christ. by Lloyd C.
