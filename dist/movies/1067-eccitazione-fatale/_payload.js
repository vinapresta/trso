Sin: Ruth calls herself a malevolent creature, ruled since childhood by hatred and envy for her adopted sister, Elizabeth. She grew up in Elizabeth’s shadow, always falling short of her goodness and generosity, constantly resenting her very presence in the family. As they grow older, Ruth sets out to destroy her without guilt or hesitation. Ruth will strike Elizabeth where she’s most vulnerable: She will steal her husband and send her collapsing into ruin. Written in Hart’s concise, striking prose, Sin is a powerful and compulsively readable exploration of hate—and the destruction and tragedy it begets. “The reader looks on with mingled shock and fascination . . . a tour de force.” —The New York Times Damage: Hart’s debut novel, a New York Times bestseller, is “a taut, sinister tale” of a man’s desperate obsession and scandalous love affair (Vanity Fair). He is a man who appears to have everything: wealth, a beautiful wife and children, and a prestigious political career in Parliament. But his life lacks passion, and his aching emptiness drives him to an all-consuming—and ultimately catastrophic—relationship with his son’s fiancée. “A passionate, elegant, ruthless story.” —Iris Murdoch “Damage is a masterpiece.” —The Washington Post",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1rJyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2018-10-23",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:"Two Novels"}},{id:6147,attributes:{title:"The Truth About Love",description:"The accidental death of a teenage boy has a profound effect on a small Irish town in this compelling new novel from the bestselling author of Damage.
