A #1 New York Times bestseller, Gone Girl is an unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that Flynn’s work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn. Flynn’s second novel, Dark Places, is an intricately orchestrated thriller that ravages a family&#39;s past to unearth the truth behind a horrifying crime.

Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer. Praise for Dark Places “[A] nerve-fraying thriller.”—The New York Times “Flynn’s well-paced story deftly shows the fallibility of memory and the lies a child tells herself to get through a trauma.”—The New Yorker “Gillian Flynn coolly demolished the notion that little girls are made of sugar and spice in Sharp Objects, her sensuous and chilling first thriller. In Dark Places, her equally sensuous and chilling follow-up, Flynn . . . has conjured up a whole new crew of feral and troubled young females. . . . [A] propulsive and twisty mystery.”—Entertainment Weekly “Flynn follows her deliciously creepy Sharp Objects with another dark tale . . . The story, alternating between the 1985 murders and the present, has a tense momentum that works beautifully. And when the truth emerges, it’s so macabre not even twisted little Libby Day could see it coming.”—People (4 stars) “Crackles with peevish energy and corrosive wit.” —Dallas Morning News “A riveting tale of true horror by a writer who has all the gifts to pull it off.”—Chicago Tribune &quot;It&#39;s Flynn&#39;s gift that she can make a caustic, self-loathing, unpleasant protagonist someone you come to root for.”—New York Magazine “[A] gripping thriller.”—Cosmopolitan &quot;Gillian Flynn is the real deal, a sharp, acerbic, and compelling storyteller with a knack for the macabre.”—Stephen King</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb4912"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=o1onswEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Gillian Flynn Collection" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Gillian Flynn Collection</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Gillian Flynn<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</span><span><span> - </span>7/30/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>GONE GIRL - THE ADDICTIVE No.1 US BESTSELLER THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT Who are you?
