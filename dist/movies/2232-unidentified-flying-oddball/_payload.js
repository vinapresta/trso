Although confused at first and quickly imprisoned, he soon realises that his knowledge of the future can transform his fate. Correctly predicting a solar eclipse from inside his prison cell, Morgan terrifies the people of England into releasing him and swiftly establishes himself as the most powerful magician in the land, stronger than Merlin and greatly admired by Arthur himself. But the Connecticut Yankee wishes for more than simply a place at the Round Table. Soon, he begins a far greater struggle: to bring American democratic ideals to Old England. Complex and fascinating, A Connecticut Yankee is a darkly comic consideration of the nature of human nature and society.

Following a violent argument with a man named Hercules, Hank is surprised to find himself under an oak tree, staring up at a man on horseback in full armor. The year is 528, and Hank has somehow landed in King Arthur’s Court in Camelot. Worse still, Hank is ridiculed by the boorish knights, brought in front of the Round Table, and sentenced to burn at the stake. Will Hank die at the hands of the Knights of the Round Table, or can his Yankee ingenuity save his hide? Mark Twain’s seminal satire sends up the South’s ridiculous preoccupation with chivalry, the Catholic Church, fear of science and progress, and dozens of other behaviors and beliefs. Credited as a foundational work of the time travel subgenre of science fiction, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court is also a timeless comic classic.

The book was originally titled A Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Some early editions are titled A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur. In the book, a Yankee engineer from Connecticut is accidentally transported back in time to the court of King Arthur, where he fools the inhabitants of that time into thinking he is a magician—and soon uses his knowledge of modern technology to become a \"magician\" in earnest, stunning the English of the Early Middle Ages with such feats as demolitions, fireworks and the shoring up of a holy well. He attempts to modernize the past, but in the end he is unable to prevent the death of Arthur and an interdict against him by the Catholic Church of the time, which grows fearful of his power. Twain wrote the book as a burlesque of Romantic notions of chivalry after being inspired by a dream in which he was a knight himself, and severely inconvenienced by the weight and cumbersome nature of his armor.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=P6atCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2015-10-08",publisher:"谷月社",subtitle:"Mark Twain's Collections"}},{id:10931,attributes:{title:"The Writings of Mark Twain: A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JnNHAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"1899-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309575864}}("","Mark Twain","movie","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court",null,"series",1))
