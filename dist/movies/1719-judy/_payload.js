Known as 'the first lady of the sliding scale', she warbled and screeched her way through the evening to an audience who mostly fell about with laughter. But this delusional and joyously happy woman paid little attention to her critics, instead she was surrounded by a circle of devoted friends who were almost as eccentric as she was. Based upon a true story, the play spins from Florence's charity recitals and extravagent balls, through to her bizarre recording sessions and an ultimate triumph at Carnegie Hall in this hilarious and heart-warming comedy. Glorious! is published to tie-in with the premiere at Birmingham Repertory Theatre, starring Maureen Lipman.

The failed marriages, the suicide attempts and the addictions are all behind her. At forty-six and with new flame Mickey Deans at her side, she seems determined to carry it off and recapture her magic. But lasting happiness always eludes some people, and there was never any answer to the question with which Judy ended every show: \"If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh, why, can't I?\" End of the Rainbow is a savagely funny drama featuring a glorious ensemble of Judy Garland hits and infused with the glamour and the melancholy of stardom. \"Every note she sings, every racket she makes, every tear she sheds, every joke she cracks, every pill she pops - is conveyed with alarming honesty. This knockout portrait of a living catastrophe should not be missed.\" What's On Published to tie-in with the premiere at the Sydney Opera House in July 2005"))
