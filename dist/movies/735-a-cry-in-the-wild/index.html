Brian Robeson has stood up to the challenge of surviving the wilderness in Hatchet, The River, Brian&#39;s Winter, and Brian&#39;s Return. Now, while camping alone on a lake in the woods, he finds a wounded and whimpering dog. As Brian treats her wounds, he worries about who or what did this to her. His instincts tell him to head north, quickly, to check on his Cree friends. With his new companion at his side, he sets out on the hunt. Gary Paulsen expertly delivers a riveting story that brilliantly combines two of his great themes: the human animal&#39;s place in nature, and the mysterious and wonderful bond between humans and dogs. “The Brian books reveal nature and humankind’s place in it with spare prose that seems ideally suited to the setting and plot.” —VOYA “Based on real incidents, this well-written sequel to Hatchet and its successors will be gobbled up by the author’s legions of fans.” —Kirkus Reviews Read all the Hatchet Adventures!

In Guts, Gary tells the real stories behind the Brian books, the stories of the adventures that inspired him to write Brian Robeson&#39;s story: working as an emergency volunteer; the death that inspired the pilot&#39;s death in Hatchet; plane crashes he has seen and near-misses of his own. He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, or how he met the moose with a sense of humor, and the moose who made it personal. There&#39;s a handy chapter on &quot;Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition.&quot; Recipes included.
