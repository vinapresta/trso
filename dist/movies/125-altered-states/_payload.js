His experiences in the chamber cause him to hallucinate, much of the imagery being religious-based although he's not religious. Seven years later, he is a respected full professor in the Harvard Medical School. Believing he has lost his edge and fallen into an unwanted state of respectability, Eddie decides to resume his work with sensory deprivation, this time using hallucinogens, specifically untested ones used in mystical Mexican rituals, to enhance the isolation-take experience. After initial tests, he claims he entered an alternate physical and mental state. Although unbelieving of Eddie's claims, his colleagues Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish, as well as Eddie's wife Emily, herself a respected academic, are concerned for Eddie's well being. However, if Eddie's claims are indeed true, he could do irreparable harm to himself and others around him, especially if his altered states are uncontrollable.",slug:"altered-states"}}},books:{data:[{id:2234,attributes:{title:f,description:"Altered States is the ultimate horror story-- the story of one young scientist's terrifying experiment to find the origins of consciousness.

He injects himself with psychedelic drugs, lies locked in an isolation tank and experiences all the stages of pre-human consciousness until finally terrible changes take place with him: Jessup also physically transforms into a pre-human being. His thirst for knowledge drives him into ever new, increasingly irreversible transformations. Only the horror when his body begins to dissolve into pure energy brings him back to human bonds... Paddy Chayefsky (January 29, 1923 â€“ August 1, 1981), one of the most important US dramatists, wrote a breath-taking, equally philosophical shocker with his debut novel. In 1980, British director Ken Russell adapted the novel based on Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay - starring: William Hurt, Blair Brown and Drew Barrymore.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nDdaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2022-01-19","BookRix"))
