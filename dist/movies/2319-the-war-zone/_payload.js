The novel has been published in eight languages and was turned into a searingly emotional film directed by Oscar-nominated actor\u002Fdirector, Tim Roth, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and went on to win international critical acclaim and many awards. This newly revised 20th Anniversary Edition includes an Afterword by Tim Roth, explaining what drew him to this controversial and painful subject matter for his directorial debut, together with both the original British and American opening chapters of the book, and Alexander Stuart's diary of the making of the film.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Z6VBQd0jEJsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2009-07-01","AuthorHouse"))
