G. Wells was originally published in 1905 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography as part of our Cryptofiction Classics series. &#39;The Empire of the Ants&#39; is a short story of a Brazilian Captain who has been sent to help a town&#39;s inhabitants fight a plague of intelligent ants. Herbert George Wells was born in Bromley, England in 1866. He apprenticed as a draper before becoming a pupil-teacher at Midhurst Grammar School in West Sussex. Some years later, Wells won a scholarship to the School of Science in London, where he developed a strong interest in biology and evolution, founding and editing the Science Schools Journal. However, he left before graduating to return to teaching, and began to focus increasingly on writing. It was in 1895 that Wells seriously established himself as a writer, with the publication of the now iconic novel, The Time Machine. Wells followed The Time Machine with the equally well-received War of the Worlds (1898), which proved highly popular in the USA. The Cryptofiction Classics series contains a collection of wonderful stories from some of the greatest authors in the genre, including Ambrose Bierce, Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jack London. From its roots in cryptozoology, this genre features bizarre, fantastical, and often terrifying tales of mythical and legendary creatures.

G. Wells. Containing over fifty tales, &quot;The Short Stories of H. G. Wells&quot; constitutes a must-have for lovers of the short storm form and is not to be missed by fans of Wells&#39; fantastic work. Herbert George Wells (1866 - 1946) was a prolific English writer who wrote in a variety of genres, including the novel, politics, history, and social commentary. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the science fiction genre thanks to such novels as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1897), and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898). &quot;The Father of Science Fiction&quot; was also a staunch socialist, and his later works are increasingly political and didactic. The stories include: &quot;The Stolen Bacillus&quot;, &quot;The Flowering of the Strange Orchid&quot;, &quot;In the Avu Observatory&quot;, &quot;The Triumphs of a Taxidermist&quot;, &quot;A Deal In Ostriches&quot;, &quot;Through a Window&quot;, &quot;The Temptation of Harringay&quot;, &quot;The Flying Man&quot;, &quot;The Diamond Maker&quot;, &quot;Aepyornis Island&quot;, &quot;The Remarkable Case of Davidson&#39;s Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Dynamos&quot;, and more. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this book now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb5725"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Empire of the Ants</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->H.

Plot Summary: Past Tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any population, and then one comes to the confluence of the main river and the Batemo arm like a great lake, and then the forest came nearer, came at last intimately near. The character of the channel changes, snags abound, and the Benjamin Constant moored by a cable that night, under the very shadow of dark trees. For the first time for many days came a spell of coolness, and Holroyd and Gerilleau sat late, smoking cigars and enjoying this delicious sensation. Gerilleau&#39;s mind was full of ants and what they could do. He decided to sleep at last, and lay down on a mattress on deck, a man hopelessly perplexed, his last words, when he already seemed asleep, were to ask, with a flourish of despair, &quot;What can one do with ants? The whole thing is absurd.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb5726"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=HW_mzQEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Empire of the Ants Illustrated" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Empire of the Ants Illustrated</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->H G Wells<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->9/30/2020</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>The Empire of the Ants is a 1905 short story by H.
