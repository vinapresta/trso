In his long literary career, he has managed the feats of welding stunning innovation to tradition, pushing the formal boundaries of literary fiction, and still capturing critical acclaim, popular success, and a worldwide readership. In Conversations with John Fowles, the first book of interviews devoted to the English writer, Dianne L. Vipond gathers over twenty of the most revealing interviews Fowles has granted in the last forty years. With critics, scholars, and journalists, he discusses his life, his art, his distinctive world view, and his special relationship with nature. Throughout his interviews, Fowles's remarkable consistency of thought is illuminated as he covers the meaning and genesis of his work. His uncompromising honesty and refreshing lack of guardedness are evident when he compares the naturalness of writing with eating or making love. From the 1960s through the 1990s, this master chronicler of the late half of the twentieth century reveals his serious engagement with social, political, and philosophical issues. He identifies himself with feminism, socialism, humanism, and the environmental movement, and he explores his recurring theme of personal, artistic, and socio-political freedom. His books, he says, \"are about the difficulty of attaining personal freedom, especially in terms of discovering what one is.\" Any reader who has been intrigued, challenged, and entertained by his work in the past is sure to find these conversations spanning the writer's career to be stimulating and revealing. Dianne L. Vipond is a professor of English at California State University, Long Beach. A co- editor of the book Literacy, Language, and Power, she has published articles in English Journal, Short Story, Twentieth Century Literature, and the Los Angeles Times.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=toF8bTBcwVMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1999-01-01",publisher:"Univ.

Fowles, whose works include The Maggot, The French Lieutenant's Woman, and The Ebony Tower, is among the most inventive and influential English novelists of the twentieth century. The first volume begins in 1949 with Fowles' final year at Oxford. It reveals his intellectual maturation, chronicling his experiences as a university lecturer in France and as a schoolteacher on the Greek island of Spetsai. Simultaneously candid and eloquent, Fowles' journals also expose the deep connection between his personal and scholarly lives as Fowles struggled to win literary acclaim. From his affair with Elizabeth, the married woman who would become his first wife, to his passion for film, ornithology, travel, and book collecting, the journals present a portrait of a man eager to experience life. The second and final volume opens in 1966, as Fowles, already an international success, navigates his newfound fame and wealth. With absolute honesty, his journals map his inner turmoil over his growing celebrity and his hesitance to take on the role of a public figure. Fowles recounts his move from London to a secluded house on England's Dorset coast, where discontented with society's voracious materialism he led an increasingly isolated life. Great works in their own right, Fowles' journals elucidate the private thoughts that gave rise to some of the greatest writing of our time.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Fxea9myG-ugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2009-01-12",publisher:"Northwestern University Press",subtitle:"Volume 1: 1949-1965"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069483731}}("movie","John Fowles","series","The Collector","",null,1,"\"A superb novel...Evil has seldom been so sinister.\" --Time Hailed as the first modern psychological thriller, The Collector is the internationally bestselling novel that catapulted John Fowles into the front rank of contemporary novelists.
