A Kiss Before Dying not only debuted the talent of best-selling novelist Ira Levin to rave reviews and an Edgar Award, it also set a new standard in the art of psychological suspense. It tells the shocking tale of a young man who will stop at nothing—not even murder—to get where he wants to go. For he has dreams; plans. He also has charm, good looks, intelligence. And he has a problem. Her name is Dorothy; she loves him, and she's pregnant. The solution may demand desperate measures. But, then, he looks like the kind of guy who could get away with murder.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FDh9BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-05-15","Simon and Schuster"))
