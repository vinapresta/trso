After an ignominious early retirement, Remington announces to his wife Serenata that heâs decided to run a marathon. This from a sedentary man in his sixties whoâs never done a lick of exercise in his life. His wife canât help but observe that his ambition is âhopelessly trite.â A loner, Serenata disdains mass group activities of any sort. Besides, his timing is cruel. Serenata has long been the coupleâs exercise freak, but by age sixty, her private fitness regimes have destroyed her knees, and sheâll soon face debilitating surgery. Yes, becoming more active would be good for Remingtonâs heart, but then why not just go for a walk? Without several thousand of your closest friends? As Remington joins the cult of fitness that increasingly consumes the Western world, her once-modest husband burgeons into an unbearable narcissist. Ignoring all his other obligations, he engages a saucy, sexy personal trainer named Bambi, who treats Serenata with contempt. When Remington sets his sights on the legendarily grueling triathlon, MettleMan, Serenata is sure heâll end up injured or dead. And even if he does survive, their marriage may not. The Motion of the Body Through Space is vintage Lionel Shriver written with psychological insight, a rich cast of characters, lots of verve and petulance, an astute reading of contemporary culture, and an emotionally resonant ending.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11351"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=cNoREAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book We Need to Talk About Kevin" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>We Need to Talk About Kevin</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lionel Shriver<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Catapult</span><span><span> - </span>5/1/2011</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>The inspiration for the film starring Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly, this resonant story of a motherâs unsettling quest to understand her teenage sonâs deadly violence, her own ambivalence toward motherhood, and the explosive link between them remains terrifyingly prescient. Eva never really wanted to be a mother. And certainly not the mother of a boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a muchâadored teacher in a school shooting two days before his sixteenth birthday. Neither nature nor nurture exclusively shapes a child&#39;s character. But Eva was always uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood. Did her internalized dislike for her own son shape him into the killer heâs become? How much is her fault? Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with Kevinâs horrific rampage, all in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. A piercing, unforgettable, and penetrating exploration of violence and responsibility, a book that the Boston Globe describes as âimpossible to put down,â is a stunning examination of how tragedy affects a town, a marriage, and a family.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11352"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=7vO25U-UcNcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Big Brother" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Big Brother</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lionel Shriver<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Harper Collins</span><span><span> - </span>6/4/2013</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Big Brother is a striking novel about siblings, marriage, and obesity from Lionel Shriver, the acclaimed author the international bestseller We Need to Talk About Kevin. For Pandora, cooking is a form of love. Alas, her husband, Fletcher, a self-employed high-end cabinetmaker, now spurns the âtoxicâ dishes that heâd savored through their courtship, and spends hours each day to manic cycling. Then, when Pandora picks up her older brother Edison at the airport, she doesnât recognize him. In the years since theyâve seen one another, the once slim, hip New York jazz pianist has gained hundreds of pounds. What happened? After Edison has more than overstayed his welcome, Fletcher delivers his wife an ultimatum: Itâs him or me. Rich with Shriverâs distinctive wit and ferocious energy, Big Brother is about fat: an issue both social and excruciatingly personal. It asks just how much sacrifice we&#39;ll make to save single members of our families, and whether it&#39;s ever possible to save loved ones from themselves.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11353"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=LBsBEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Should We Stay or Should We Go" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Should We Stay or Should We Go</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lionel Shriver<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by HarperCollins</span><span><span> - </span>6/8/2021</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>When her father dies, Kay Wilkinson canât cry. Over ten years, Alzheimerâs had steadily eroded this erudite man into a paranoid lunatic. Surely oneâs own father passing should never come as such a relief. Both medical professionals, Kay and her husband Cyril have seen too many elderly patients in similar states of decay. Although healthy and vital in their early fifties, the couple fears what may lie ahead. Determined to die with dignity, Cyril makes a modest proposal. To spare themselves and their loved ones such a humiliating and protracted decline, they should agree to commit suicide together once theyâve both turned eighty. When their deal is sealed, the spouses are blithely looking forward to another three decades together. But then they turn eighty. By turns hilarious and touching, playful and grave, Should We Stay or Should We Go portrays twelve parallel universes, each exploring a possible future for Kay and Cyril. Were they to cut life artificially short, what would they miss out on? Something terrific? Or something terrible? Might they end up in a home? A fabulous luxury retirement village, or a Cuckooâs Nest sort of home? Might being demented end up being rather fun? What future for humanity awaitsâthe end of civilization, or a Valhalla of peace and prosperity? What if cryogenics were really to work? What if scientists finally cure aging? Both timely and timeless, Lionel Shriver addresses serious themesâthe compromises of longevity, the challenge of living a long life and still going out in styleâwith an uncannily light touch. Weaving in a host of contemporary issues, from Brexit and mass migration to the coronavirus, Shriver has pulled off a rollicking page-turner in which we never have to mourn perished characters, because theyâll be alive and kicking in the very next chapter.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDE0MjYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2NTY5Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster We Need to Talk About Kevin" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie We Need to Talk About Kevin is based on the book We Need to Talk about Kevin? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Eva&#39;s a mother trying to piece together her life following an incident caused by her odd child, Kevin.
