The army wagon train carried rifles, ammunition, and a chestful of gold through Apache territory, where every white man was a target. With the soldiers rode a single stagecoach carrying the woman whom Chris Danning planned to marry. When the train passed through Karnes Canyon, an Apache raiding party stormed out of the shadows, and the creek ran red with blood. For eighteen months now, Danning has searched for the Apache who attacked the wagon train and killed his fiancée. He’s also hunting the corrupt white man who sold the soldiers out. With the help of a grizzled Indian scout, Danning finally gets the name of the Apache chief and a description of their informer. When he finds them, the real battle will begin. A truly unique saga of vengeance and obsession in the American West, Coroner Creek—which was made into a 1948 Columbia Pictures film starring Randolph Scott—explores the darkest parts of the cowboy soul. .",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=X4D1DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:a}},{id:712,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1956-01-01",publisher:"Bantam Books",subtitle:a}},{id:713,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Luke SHORT (pseud.)"],firstBook:e,published:"1947-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:714,attributes:{title:"Ramrod",description:"A strong-willed woman enlists a hard-bitten gunslinger to fight a ranch war in this classic western drama from an award–winning author. Dave Nash smells trouble the moment he rides into Signal. He’s only been working for Walt Shipley three weeks, but he feels he owes the man his life for giving him a job when no one else would. Now, Nash will do anything for Shipley—even if it means staring down the barrel of a gun. He’ll face any danger for his new boss, but he hasn’t reckoned on the most dangerous creature of all: a conniving frontier woman. Connie Dickason is the most seductive woman in Signal, and Shipley has his heart set on marrying her. But a brewing war with a powerful cattleman drives Shipley from town, leaving Connie and Nash to defend the ranch together. The ranch hand soon discovers that the boss’s wife will stop at nothing to get what she wants.
