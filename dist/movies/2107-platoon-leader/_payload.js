All of the authors are active or retired United States Army officers with more than 140 years of collective military operational experience among them.

McDonough","Presidio Press",null,"Platoon Leader","A remarkable memoir of small-unit leadership and the coming of age of a young soldier in combat in Vietnam.' \"Using a lean style and a sense of pacing drawn from the tautest of novels, McDonough has produced a gripping account of his first command, a U.S. platoon taking part in the 'strategic hamlet' program. . . . Rather than present a potpourri of combat yarns. . . McDonough has focused a seasoned storyteller’s eye on the details, people, and incidents that best communicate a visceral feel of command under fire. . . . For the author’s honesty and literary craftsmanship, Platoon Leader seems destined to be read for a long time by second lieutenants trying to prepare for the future, veterans trying to remember the past, and civilians trying to understand what the profession of arms is all about.”–Army Times","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=M1TFhSqXTs4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2007-12-18","A Memoir of Command in Combat","The Defense of Hill 781","“Brilliant, hardhitting description of modern war on the U.S. Army’s premier training ground. A must-read tactical primer for today’s warrior.”—John C. “Doc” Bahnsen, Brigadier General, USA (Ret.) At the turn of the century a small, humorous book on tactics was published. The Defense of Duffer’s Drift quickly became a bestseller and today is still widely read. The Defense of Hill 781 is a modem version of this classic—a tactical primer with ample funpoking, but with serious lessons to be learned. Lt. Col. A. Tack Always Finds himself in the California high desert, alone, disheveled, confused. A guide soon appears to inform him of his situation: He has died and is now in Purgatory (his humility in the Army was somewhat lacking) where he must atone for past sins. Purgatory is, aptly, the U.S. Army’s National Training Center (NTC), and Lt. Col. Always may earn his way out by completing a successful mission. Through a series of six missions, the reader plans and fights with Lt. Col. Always, making the split-second decisions that determine victory or defeat, life or death. Through successive difficulties, some important lessons are burned into the commander’s brain—lessons about tactics, about people, about what it takes to fight a winning battle. Like Duffer’s Drift this book is a valuable resource for all military tacticians. For the armchair general, it is a fascinating look at how the members of a military unit work together in combat.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=zGDZ43PhWEIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2010-03-03","An Allegory of Modern Mechanized Combat"))
