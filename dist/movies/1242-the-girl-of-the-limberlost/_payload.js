Elnora Comstock, though void of her mother's love and affection, was determined to go against the odds and reach her dreams. She has always believed that she will never remain a small town girl. In fact, this persevering young woman maintained a positive disposition as she proved herself to be worthy of people's - and most especially her mother's - admiration. As a student, she managed to excel in class, gain new friends, and play the violin with so much refinement. She was able to achieve all these through her strong yearning to succeed, coupled with the selfless love and constant support of the Sintons. Elnora, who was once an unknown girl in her school, transformed into an extraordinary and confident young lady. Elnora's life became more interesting when she met Philip, a charming man who eventually fell in love with her. Much to her disappointment, however, she learned that this man was engaged to Edith, a spoiled and wealthy woman. Nevertheless, she accepted the fact that he was not the man for her and decided to move on despite the heartache. This novel by Gene Stratton-Porter will leave you enchanted and immersed by the characters' unique traits, struggles and realizations that make them distinct from each other. Indeed,","Gene Stratton Porter"))
