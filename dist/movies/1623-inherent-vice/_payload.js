It's been a while since Doc Sportello has seen his ex- girlfriend. Suddenly she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that \"love\" is another of those words going around at the moment, like \"trip\" or \"groovy,\" except that this one usually leads to trouble.
