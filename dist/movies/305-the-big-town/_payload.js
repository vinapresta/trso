But in Clarkton, a small Massachusetts factory town, a high-stakes labor battle quickly turns violent, turning what should be a time of peace and prosperity into a bloody conflict that draws in every citizen. No one remains untouched, from rigid factory owner George Clark Lowell, to a small army of labor organizers of every background, to reptilian strike-buster Hamilton Gelb, to the shopkeepers, barbers, and priests that watch in confusion and horror as the nightmare unfolds. Clarkton is a potent novel of one town’s fight against oppression, and a chilling reflection on the American labor movement after the Second World War.

Then he met a seductive woman named Lorry, who was playing a game of her own, and she wasn’t about to let any rules get in her way . . .
