Then he becomes involved in the operation of a coal company on a remote island in the Malay Archipelago, and when it fails he turns his back on humanity once more. But his life alters when he rescues a young English girl, Lena, from Zangiacomo's Ladies' Orchestra and the evil innkeeper Schomberg, taking her to his island retreat. The affair between Heyst and Lena begins with her release, but the relationship shifts as Lena struggles to save Heyst from detachment and isolation. Featuring arguably the most interesting hero created by Conrad, Victory is both a compelling tale of adventure and a perceptive study of the power of love.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=8phPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:"2016-02-16",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:h}},{id:11123,attributes:{title:b,description:"A story of rescue and violent tragedy set in the Malayan archipelago, 'Victory' combines high adventure with a sensitive portrayal of three drifters.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=1wYmAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1915-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:h}},{id:11124,attributes:{title:b,description:"Victory (also published as Victory: An Island Tale) is a psychological novel by Joseph Conrad first published in 1915, through which Conrad achieved \"popular success.\" The New York Times, however, called it \"an uneven book\" and \"more open to criticism than most of Mr. Conrad's best work.\" The novel's \"most striking formal characteristic is its shifting narrative and temporal perspective\"[4] with the first section from the viewpoint of a sailor, the second from omniscient perspective of Axel Heyst, the third from an interior perspective from Heyst, and the final section has an omniscient narrator.
