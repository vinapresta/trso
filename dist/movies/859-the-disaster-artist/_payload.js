Described by one reviewer as \"like getting stabbed in the head,\" the six-million-dollar film earned a grand total of $1800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Ten years later, The Room is an international cult phenomenon. Thousands of fans wait in line for hours to attend screenings complete with costumes, audience rituals, merchandising, and thousands of plastic spoons. In The Disaster Artist, actor Greg Sestero, Tommy's costar and longtime best friend, recounts the film's long, strange journey to infamy, unraveling mysteries for fans--who on earth is \"Steven,\" and what's with that hospital on Guerrero Street?--as well as the question that plagues the uninitiated: how the hell did a movie this awful ever get made? But more than just a laugh-out-loud funny story about cinematic hubris, The Disaster Artist is also a great piece of narrative nonfiction, a portrait of a mysterious man who got past every road block in the Hollywood system to achieve success on his own terms. Written with a gimlet eye but an open heart, The Disaster Artist is the hilarious and inspiring story of a dream that just wouldn't die\"--",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=k8k_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c,d],firstBook:true,published:"2017-11-28",publisher:g,subtitle:h}},{id:5272,attributes:{title:"Summary and Analysis of the Disaster Artist",description:"Learn About Tommy Wiseau and The Best Bad Movie Ever Made In A Fraction Of The Time It Takes To Read The Actual Book!!!Today only, get this 1# Amazon bestseller for just $2.99. Regularly priced at $9.99. Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device The opening chapter of Sestero's book introduces us to Tommy Wiseau, the eccentric filmmaker himself, as he treats his friend, Greg Sestero, to a celebratory dinner at Hollywood's Palm Restaurant. Filming of Wiseau's film, The Room, starts the following day. Sestero explains that Wiseau wrote, directed, produced, cast, and starred in the film—a true passion project. Sestero spends the majority of this chapter detailing Wiseau's all around strangeness. For example, Tommy's hair is long and unkempt, he wears outdated clothes with two (yes, two) belts on his pants, and he drinks glasses of hot water with every meal. Two girls come over to the table, introducing themselves and flirting accordingly, and Wiseau—who speaks in broken English—insults them viciously and hilariously in a French(ish) accent. Wiseau then racks up a huge bill, barely tips the waiter, and storms out of the restaurant in traditional Tommy Wiseau fashion. Wiseau then drives himself and Sestero from the restaurant at a mere twenty miles per hour in his Mercedes. In the car, Tommy makes Greg an interesting offer the day before his film's production; Tommy wants Greg to star in The Room as Mark, a character who betrays Tommy's lead character, Johnny.
