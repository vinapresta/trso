Excerpt: \"It was that hour when the old hunter on the trail takes off his pack, silently gathers wood for a fire, eats his dinner and smokes his pipe, eyes and ears alert;—that hour when if you speak above a whisper, he will say to you, \"Sh-h-h-h! Be quiet! You can't tell how near we are to game. Everything has had its morning feed and is lying low. The game won't be moving again for an hour or two, and there may be moose or caribou a gunshot ahead. We couldn't hear them—now!\" James Oliver Curwood was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. His books ranked among top-ten best sellers in the United States and at least eighteen motion pictures have been based on or directly inspired by his novels and short stories. At the time of his death, he was the highest paid (per word) author in the world. His writing studio, Curwood Castle, is now a museum in Owosso, Michigan.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=w1hODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2017-10-06",publisher:"Musaicum Books",subtitle:"Western Mystery: A Dangerous Treasure Hunt and the Story of Life and Adventure in the Hudson Bay Wilds"}},{id:12043,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:e,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:f,publisher:a,subtitle:g}},{id:12044,attributes:{title:c,description:"A Story of Life and Adventure in the Hudson Bay Wilds.
