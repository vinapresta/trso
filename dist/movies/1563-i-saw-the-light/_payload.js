Originally published as Hank William: The Biography. In his brief life, Hank Williams created one of the defining bodies of American music. Songs such as \"Your Cheatin' Heart,\" \"Hey, Good Lookin',\" and \"Jambalaya\" sold millions of records and became the model for virtually all country music that followed. But by the time of his death at age twenty-nine, Williams had drunk and drugged and philandered his way through two messy marriages and out of his headline spot on the Grand Ole Opry. Even though he was country music's top seller, toward the end he was so famously unreliable that he was lucky to get a booking in a beer hall. Colin Escott's enthralling, definitive biograph--now the basis of the major motion picture I Saw the Light--vividly details the singer's stunning rise and his spectacular decline, revealing much that was previously unknown or hidden about the life of this country music legend.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Nlk_jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,e,d],firstBook:c,published:"2015-11-10",publisher:"Back Bay Books",subtitle:"The Story of Hank Williams"}},{id:8192,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[d,b,e],firstBook:c,published:l,publisher:m,subtitle:n}},{id:8193,attributes:{title:"The Encyclopedia of Popular Music",description:"This text presents a comprehensive and up-to-date reference work on popular music, from the early 20th century to the present day.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Colin Larkin"],firstBook:c,published:"2011-05-27",publisher:"Omnibus Press",subtitle:""}},{id:8194,attributes:{title:"Roadkill on the Three-chord Highway",description:"Featuring stories that will fascinate even the most casual fan of popular music, \"Roadkill on the Three-Chord Highway\" includes true accounts about major stars--from Perry Como to Roy Orbison--as well as tales about the \"Tex Nobodies\" that populate the back alleys of American music. 35 black-and-white photos.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FKsSBREliAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2002-01-01",publisher:"Psychology Press",subtitle:"Art and Trash in American Popular Music"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309522152}}("movie","Colin Escott",null,"William MacEwen","George Merritt","series",1,"I Saw the Light","Hank Williams","- Long considered the last word on Hank Williams, this biography has remained continuously in print since its first publication in 1994.- This new edition has been completely updated and includes many previously unpublished photographs, as well as a complete catalog detailing all the songs Hank Williams ever wrote, even those he never recorded.- Colin Escott is codirector and cowriter of the forth-coming two-hour PBS\u002FBBC television documentary on Hank Williams, set to broadcast in spring 2004, and coauthor of \"Hank Williams: Snapshots from the Lost Highway.- HANK WILLIAMS was the third-prize winner of the prestigious Ralph J.
