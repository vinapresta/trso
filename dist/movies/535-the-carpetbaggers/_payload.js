With the exception of a few trusted people including his best friend, aging cowboy Nevada Smith, business manager \"Mac\" McAllister, and longtime butler Jedidiah, Jonas in turn trusts no one in his effort to take complete control of the business and his life, buying out other \"friends\", business associates and adversaries in his \"I know best\" attitude. In the process, he begins to diversify his business interests into areas which he either has an interest and\u002For believes will be industries of the immediate future, including aviation and the movie industry. The poor way he treats people extends to his personal life, including the many women closest to him, such as his stepmother, Rina Marlowe, who was his girlfriend before she married his father, and who would become his wife, Monica Winthrop, the daughter of a business associate. The question becomes if this life is sustainable for him, especially as people try to usurp him, and those he trusts may no longer be able to tolerate his behavior, which he may not be able to let go of in much of it stemming from issues ingrained into him when he was a child.",slug:"the-carpetbaggers"}}},books:{data:[{id:3932,attributes:{title:d,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:k,publisher:e,subtitle:a}},{id:3933,attributes:{title:d,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:k,publisher:e,subtitle:a}},{id:3934,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"1962-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:3935,attributes:{title:"The Predators",description:"The Predators combines in one novel the finest attributes of A Stone for Danny Fisher and The Carpetbaggers.

He prides himself on never having worked a day in his life. He has everything he wants - fast cars, beautiful women, a racing yacht, a penthouse in Manhattan. Orphaned at eleven, Win inherited an international diamond business that is managed by his uncle. Then Win loses it all when his uncle commits suicide after investing all of Win's money in a scheme that fails. His single remaining asset is a bankrupt diamond mine in Angola, a steaming, war-ravaged country in equatorial Africa. In the blood and muck of central Africa, Win experiences the \"Diamond Curse\" first hand. Battles over Angola's vast wealth in gems occur daily, and fights for control of the diamond industry have wiped out generations. Thriving on the challenge, Win founds an international diamond business that challenges a powerful cartel's stranglehold on the market. Loved by two women - a movie goddess who sears men's souls and a dedicated UN worker who risks her life in Africa - Win doesn't find anything worth living for until he loses love. From the tunnels of the diamond mine to the stage at the Academy Awards, from the beds of beautiful women to a battle with warlords, Win has to fight to get back everything he ever wanted.
