The delicate peace is inadvertantly shattered when a group of new homesteaders lay down their stakes on the cattlemen's side of town, upsetting the delicate balance that had existed thus far and sparking an all-out war between the farmers, who want the land tamed and property lines drawn, and the cowboys, who want the prairies to be open for their cattle to roam.",slug:"abilene-town"}}},books:{data:[{id:1903,attributes:{title:e,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:1904,attributes:{title:e,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:1905,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1956-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Western Novel"}},{id:1906,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:a}},{id:1907,attributes:{title:l,description:m,thumbnail:n,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:o,publisher:p,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309113635}}("","Ernest Haycox","movie",null,"Trail Town","series",1,"LAW AND ORDER WERE HIS GAME.

But Sheriff Dan Mitchell wasn’t worried about rowdy cowpokes—the man with the star was as quick with his gun as he was with his fists...and his wits. When it came to law and order, he meant business: Trouble was the saloonkeepers and the so-called respectable folks who had put him in office, had their own notions as to the extent of the law.
