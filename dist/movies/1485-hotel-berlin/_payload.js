Among the guests of the hotel is Doctor Otternschlag, a World War I veteran whose face has been sliced in half by a shell. Day after day he emerges to read the paper in the lobby, discreetly inquiring at the desk if the letter he’s been awaiting for years has arrived. Then there is Grusinskaya, a great ballerina now fighting a losing battle not so much against age as against her fear of it, who may or may not be made for Gaigern, a sleek professional thief. Herr Preysing also checks in, the director of a family firm that isn’t as flourishing as it appears, who would never imagine that Kringelein, his underling, a timorous petty clerk he’s bullied for years, has also come to Berlin, determined to live at last now that he’s received a medical death sentence. All these characters and more, with all their secrets and aspirations, come together and come alive in the pages of Baum’s delicious and disturbing masterpiece.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jwooDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2016-06-07",publisher:"New York Review of Books",subtitle:a}},{id:7871,attributes:{title:h,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1960-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:7872,attributes:{title:g,description:"Berlin's mythical Grand Hotel, whose patrons glitter with the same cold brilliance as the art-deco trappings that surround them, is the scene where the lives of various guests become intertwined.

Powerful German businessman Preysing brow beats Kringelein, one of his company's lowly bookeepers but it is the terminally ill Kringelein who hold all the cards in the end.
