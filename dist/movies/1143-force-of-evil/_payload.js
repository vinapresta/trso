The idea for Tucker's People stemmed from Ira Wolfert's coverage as a reporter of the trial of James Jimmy Hines, a Tammany Hall district leader who was prosecuted by Thomas E. Dewey for letting Dutch Schultz take over the numbers game in New York. It is a penetrating, sympathetic novel of frustration and insecurity, a story of little people, many of them decent people, battling against forces they are too feeble to resist and too simple to understand, according to the Saturday Review of Literature.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7JBYIRu-DZsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1997-01-01","University of Illinois Press"))
