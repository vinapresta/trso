All along the way, Foote carefully identifies the people and influences that shaped his character and nurtured his art. What is remarkable about this book is equally remarkable about his drama: he writes with an effortlessness that belies the intimacy of the art emanating from deep within. The stories are simply told, but complex in their resonance. Foote not only reveals his immediate professional world, but he also provides a running commentary on the changes in American culture. This book makes for as fascinating reading as it does compelling history. On December 20, 2000, President Bill Clinton conferred the National Medal of Arts on Texas dramatist, Horton Foote, and noted that Foote's six-decade-long, award-winning career established him as the nation's most prolific writer for stage, film, and television. Foote's many awards include two Academy Awards, an Emmy, a Burkey Award and the Screen Laurel Award from the Writers Guild of America, the Lucille Lortel Award, and his induction into both the Theatre Hall of Fame and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Without question, Horton Foote has enriched American literature with his unique writing style and his truthful examinations of the human condition. Besides To Kill A Mockingbird and The Trip To Bountiful, Foote has written a score of notable plays, teleplays, and films.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=J-s_vTJsArIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,"Marion Castleberry"],firstBook:d,published:"2004-01-01",publisher:"Baylor University Press",subtitle:b}},{id:12768,attributes:{title:"Cousins ; And, The Death of Papa",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=eEMroFBjDPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:"The Final Two Plays of The Orphans' Home Cycle"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309107993}}("Horton Foote","","movie",null,"series",1,"The Trip to Bountiful","1989-01-01","Grove Press"))
