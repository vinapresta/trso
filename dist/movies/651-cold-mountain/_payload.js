Now, the beloved American epic returns, reissued by Grove Press to coincide with the publication of Frazier’s eagerly-anticipated second novel, Thirteen Moons. Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, a Confederate soldier named Inman decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains to Ada, the woman he loves. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father’s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=L9ve3Zz__1cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2007-12-01",publisher:"Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc.",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:4415,attributes:{title:a,description:"\"A rare and extraordinary book . . . heart-stopping . . . spellbinding.\"--San Francisco Chronicle \"A page turner that attains the status of literature.\"--Newsweek \"Finely drawn, full of dark beauty and presentiment.\"--New Yorker \"An astonishing first novel.\"--New York Review of Books Charles Frazier's debut novelCold Mountain made publishing history in 1997 when it stood at the top of theNew York Times best-seller list for sixty-one weeks, won numerous literary awards, including the National Book Award, and went on to sell over three million copies.
