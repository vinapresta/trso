But some of the best and most significant events of Tiber's life did not happen until After Woodstock. In this third volume of his memoirs, following the critically acclaimed Palm Trees on the Hudson and his breakout bestseller Taking Woodstock, Tiber chronicles his hilarious, madcap, and often heartbreaking adventures in the entertainment industry. Guided as much by chutzpah as by his creative drive, Tiber travels around the world, always looking to grab the brass ring. And everywhere he goes, from Hollywood to Brussels, Tiber makes his indelible, irreverent, unique mark. Along the way, Tiber meets the celebrated Belgian playwright and director André Ernotte. Over the course of his decades-long relationship with Ernotte, Tiber realizes his potential as a humorist and writer, and finds a way to cope with his difficult mother, whose second wedding in the hills of Israel gives new meaning to the Wailing Wall. The relationship is tested by the AIDS crisis and a string of professional disappointments, but ultimately endures the test of time. With Ernotte, Tiber finally learns the true meaning of love. A passionate and joyful evocation of a very different time, After Woodstock reminds us how the search for love and meaning drives us forward.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=6beKmwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2015-03-02",publisher:f,subtitle:"The True Story of a Belgian Movie, an Israeli Wedding, & a Manhattan Breakdown"}},{id:12132,attributes:{title:"Palm Trees on the Hudson",description:"*** IBPA Benjamin Franklin Award WINNER (AUDIOBOOK - Nonfiction category) *** Palm Trees on the Hudson is the hilarious prequel to Elliot Tiber’s bestseller Taking Woodstock. Before Elliot found financial success by bringing Woodstock Ventures to his upstate motel, he was one of Manhattan’s leading interior designers. Then Elliot’s career came to a halt due to a floating society party, Judy Garland, and the Mob. In April 1968, Elliot was hired to throw an elegant dinner party aboard a luxury yacht on the Hudson River. Included on the guest list were New York’s rich and famous—politicians, financiers, and even Elliot’s icon, Judy Garland. The big night arrived. But when a fight broke out, resulting in the destruction of everything including rented palms, Elliot’s event turned into financial disaster. Things couldn’t get any worse—or so it seemed until the Mob paid a visit. By turns comic and tragic, Palm Trees on the Hudson is the take-no-prisoners memoir that gives readers a more intimate look at the man who went on to fight back at Stonewall and who helped give birth to the Woodstock Nation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jyesDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2012-06-18",publisher:"Square One Publishers, Inc.",subtitle:"A True Story of the Mob, Judy Garland, and Interior Decorating"}},{id:12133,attributes:{title:"Knock on Woodstock",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1994-01-01",publisher:"Joel Friedlander Pub",subtitle:"The Uproarious, Uncensored Story of the Woodstock Festival, the Gay Man who Made it Happen, and how He Earned His Ticket to Freedom"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940914698}}("","Elliot Tiber",null,"Taking Woodstock","Tom Monte","Square One Pub"))
