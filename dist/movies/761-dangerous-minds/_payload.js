And if that didn't work, the pretty, petite ex-marine told them she'd been trained to kill with her bare hands. They were called the class from Hell-thirty-four inner city sophomores she inherited from a teacher who'd been \"pushed over the edge.\" She was told \"those kids have tasted blood. They're dangerous.\" But LouAnne Johnson had a different idea. Where the school system saw thirty-four unreachable kids, she saw young men and women with intelligence and dreams. When others gave up on them, she broke the rules to give them the best things a teacher can give-hope and belief in themselves. When statistics showed the chances were they'd never graduate, she fought to beat the odds. This is her remarkable story-and theirs. If you loved Stand and Deliver, you'll stand up and cheer for LouAnne Johnson and Dangerous Minds.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wnYY7ZI1lcsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1995-09-15","St. Martin's Paperbacks","A Funny & Inspiring Story of Teaching","John Wiley & Sons"))
