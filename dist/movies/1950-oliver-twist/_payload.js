Orphaned at birth, Oliver Twist grows up under the loveless, relentless watch of a workhouse. He runs away with hopes for a better life in London, only to become--at the hands of the unforgettable Artful Dodger--a guileless pawn in a gang of pickpockets and robbers working for Fagin, one of Dickens's most controversial villains. Full of ingenious plot twists, at turns thrilling, tragic, tender, and sharp-eyed, The Adventures of Oliver Twist is among Dickens's most enduring classics.
