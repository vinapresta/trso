An intimate reception at the Ottawa residence of Her Majesty’s governor general . . . The arrival of a ship in Vancouver. Three seemingly unrelated events three thousand miles apart upset the balance of global power and alter the landscape of the free world. As Canada’s prime minister, James Howden, works to ensure his nation’s survival in a nuclear war, he faces another threat: a lawyer on a crusade for justice and truth. With two nations struggling to keep a lid on an explosive secret, Howden will undergo a crisis of conscience that leaves him fighting for his political life.

Change is in the air when a new board chairman sets out to modernize and expand Three Counties Hospital in Burlington, Pennsylvania—a once venerable institution whose standards have slipped. Dynamic Dr. Kent O’Donnell, a Harvard Medical School–trained surgeon, accepts the board’s offer to lead and reform the rundown, disorganized hospital because he wants to make his mark on the world. As medical-board president, O’Donnell faces his greatest challenge in Dr. Joe Pearson, Three Counties’ elderly head pathologist. Once an excellent diagnostician, Pearson is now out of touch with the latest research and procedures in laboratory medicine. But if the hospital lets the imperious doctor go, it risks losing an important benefactor’s financial support. Arthur Hailey’s fascinating, dramatic, and scrupulously researched story reveals both the professional, personal, and romantic aspects of an administrator-surgeon’s life, as well as the tragedies and moments of joy that occur every day in a hospital—a place where life often begins and ends.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IvF3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2015-10-20"))
