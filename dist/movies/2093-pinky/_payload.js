Pinky tells her grandmother that she has been \"passing\" for white at school in the North. In addition, Pinky has fallen in love with a young white doctor, Dr. Thomas Adams, who knows nothing about her black heritage. Pinky says that she will return to the North, but Granny Johnson convinces her to stay and treat an ailing white woman, Miss Em. Meanwhile, Dr. Canady, a black physician from another part of the state, visits Pinky and asks her to train some African American students, but she declines. Pinky nurses Miss Em but is resentful because she feels that she is doing the same thing her grandmother did. Pinky and Miss Em slowly develop a mutual respect for each other. Mrs. Em leaves Pinky her property when she dies, but relatives of the deceased woman contest the new will in court. To raise money for the court fees, Pinky washes clothes by hand with her grandmother. The court rules in Pinky's favor and she keeps the land. Tom wants her to resume her life as a white woman and to marry him, but she refuses.

If you could look at our world with fresh eyes, wouldn’t it give you a whole new perspective on life and help you to rediscover its true values? Well, Tammy, the lovable young girl you’ll meet in these pages, does just that. Before things began to happen, you see, Tammy had lived all her seventeen years on a Mississippi shantyboat. It was a very simple, quiet, isolated life she had had with her grandparents. But then, after Pete Brent was rescued from the river, things changed, and Tammy found herself at Brenton Hall, where there were some marvelous contrivances and concoctions and also some curious ideas and customs and ways of speaking. Life wasn’t so simple for Tammy any more. In fact, Pete’s mother, Professor Brent, Pete himself, the lovely Barbara, Aunt Renie, and Ernie (especially Ernie) posed many problems. But Tammy, a most unusual and most enduring creature, came through with flying colours. And her story—a warm, lively, engaging story—is the kind that makes you laugh aloud, perhaps stirs a tear or two as well, and along with the entertainment, brings inspiration, a fresh perspective through which you may find strength and a new peace of mind.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=FcZQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:m,publisher:f,subtitle:e}},{id:1353,attributes:{title:"A View from the Hill",description:"THE FORTUNE TELLER TOLD HER—“YOU AIN’T DONE LIVING YET!” In A View from the Hill, popular author of novels such as Ann Singleton (1938) and But the Morning Will Come (1949), Cid Ricketts Sumner, paints a vivid picture of a woman’s mature years made rich by living life to the fullest in a series of brief essays on friendship, love, and finding new interests.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=E8ZQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:m,publisher:f,subtitle:d}},{id:1354,attributes:{title:"But the Morning Will Come",description:"Originally published in 1949, this book tells the story of a Southern white girl and her reaction when she discovers that her unborn child will inherit Negro blood. Bentley Carr grew up without knowing she was a very pretty girl. Daughter of a seamstress in a Mississippi town, she felt overwhelmed when she became the bride of Philip Churston of Cedar Bluff plantation. She was happy when she knew she was to bear him a child. Happy—until she discovered why the whisper ran about the Churstons: a strain of Negro blood in the family! That was why Philip was cold to the coming heir; why there were never any visitors at Cedar Bluff. Her dilemma faced her starkly: must she, too, learn to live a lie? “Grace in the writing, warm appreciation of the emotional involvements, and of the relationship between background and action....”—W.
