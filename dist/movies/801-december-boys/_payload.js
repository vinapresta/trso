He was living in a Catholic orphanage in the Australian outback. His best mates were the \"December boys\" - Maps, Spark and Spit - the four of them so named because they were the boys in the orphanage born in the month of December. With a recent windfall, the orphanage decided to give each of the boys a group vacation for each of their birthdays, the December boys the first to go. Their vacation was to Lady Star Cove on the Australian coast, to stay at the home of Mrs. and Mrs. McAnsh - Bandy and \"Skipper\". Their relatively carefree Christmas vacation took a turn primarily from three events: learning the reason the McAnshes hosted the boys specifically at this time; Maps, the oldest in his mid-teens, exploring his sexuality with a girl named Lucy, who was also visiting Lady Star Cove for the summer; and Misty secretly learning that a young couple in the cove, Fearless and Teresa, were thinking about adopting one of them, the couple who were unable to conceive a child of their own. Beyond the dreams of especially the younger three to be adopted by a loving family, Fearless had the extra wow factor of being a stunt motorcyclist as his profession. Misty, the youngest, tried the hardest to be the one chosen, even initially keeping the fact of Fearless and Teresa thinking about adopting one of them from the other three. Misty concludes his story with the reason why he is telling it at this stage in his life.",slug:"december-boys"}}},books:{data:[{id:5018,attributes:{title:b,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:d}},{id:5019,attributes:{title:b,description:e,thumbnail:f,authors:[c],firstBook:a,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:d}},{id:5020,attributes:{title:b,description:"Eine Geschichte über das Erwachsenwerden und den Wert von Freundschaft Der Roman erzählt von fünf Teenagern, die in den 30er Jahren in einem tristen, katholischen Konvent im australischen Outback aufwachsen.

For a time, “Dell Comics Are Good Comics” was more than a slogan—it was a simple statement of fact. Many of the stories written and drawn by people like Carl Barks (Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge), John Stanley (Little Lulu), and Walt Kelly (Pogo) repay reading and rereading by educated adults even today, decades after they were published as disposable entertainment for children. Such triumphs were improbable, to say the least, because midcentury comics were so widely dismissed as trash by angry parents, indignant librarians, and even many of the people who published them. It was all but miraculous that a few great cartoonists were able to look past that nearly universal scorn and grasp the artistic potential of their medium. With clarity and enthusiasm, Barrier explains what made the best stories in the Dell comic books so special. He deftly turns a complex and detailed history into an expressive narrative sure to appeal to an audience beyond scholars and historians.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IbUwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[i],firstBook:a,published:"2014-11-27",publisher:j,subtitle:"The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940953509}}(null,"The December Boys","Michael Noonan","","They are known as the \"December boys\" because all of them - Chocker (who tells the story, Fido, Spark, Misty and Maps - are thought to have been born in that month. And one December in the late 1930s they leave their Catholic orphanage in the dusty outback to spend the Christmas holidays at the seaside settlement of Captain s Folly, staying with the eccentric Mr and Mrs McAnsh, who are partial to pumpkin wine. Wearing bathing costumes made from four-bags dyed black, the boys meet the ocean for the first time and are soon racing through the sandhills to plunge in the surf. But it is Teresa, the young wife of Fearless Foley, former stunt rider on the Wall of Death, who becomes the focus of those holidays, setting off intense ribaldry and competition between the boys which leads to a totally unexpected ending. The December Boys is a classic tale of an unforgettable summer beside the Pacific Ocean. First published in 1963, it was commended in the Miles Franklin Award.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IQ64UXh3h2UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2006-01-01","Univ. of Queensland Press","Michael Barrier","Univ of California Press"))
