Pip has been killing his time by getting high--trying to avoid thinking about his family life, trying not to notice that his younger brother isn't the same sweet, happy kid he used to be.

Until he meets Curt MacCrae, an emaciated, semi-homeless, high school dropout guitar genius, the stuff of which Lower East Side punk rock legends are made. Never mind that Troy’s dad thinks Curt’s a drug addict and Troy’s brother thinks Troy’s the biggest (literally) loser in Manhattan. Soon, Curt’s recruited Troy as his new drummer—even though Troy can’t play the drums. Together, Curt and Troy will change the world of punk, and Troy’s own life, forever. \"Troy's voice is candid, irreverent, realistic and humorous.
