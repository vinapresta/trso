A fishing trip is anything but relaxing when Travis McGee is involved. As McGee and his friend Meyer settle down to some midnight casting, a woman falls into the water from the bridge above them.

With alert empathy, he follows Jack Carter as he hunts down his brother&#39;s killers in Ted Lewis&#39;s masterpiece Jack&#39;s Return Home (&quot;a kind of dark English Gatsby&quot;) ; suffers along with violence-averse Rae Ingram coping alone on a small yacht with a dangerous paranoid in Dead Calm (&quot;a philosophical thriller&quot;) by that fine Gold Medal novelist Charles Williams; and gives a lot of attention to Donald Hamilton&#39;s young professional men entangled with enigmatic young women in pre-Helm works like The Steel Mirror (1948) where he was learning his craft. In a fourth chapter, he hacks at the wall between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;entertainment&quot; and loose talk about the &quot;world&quot; of the thriller. Lastly, he reminiscences about a fascinating safari that he made into the sex-&#39;n-violence &quot;Mushroom Jungle&quot; (British pulp fiction ca.1946-54), and offers conclusions about violence and peace. He avoids jargon, combines an aficionado&#39;s enthusiasm with a scholar&#39;s accuracy, quotes generously to convey the texture of a work, provides background information for readers new to the topic, and illuminates &quot;craft&quot; aspects of fiction in general. His emphasis throughout is positive.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb4932"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=MuJo732OCb4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Green Ripper" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Green Ripper</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->John D.

Travis McGee has known his share of beautiful girls, but true love always passed him by—until Gretel. Life aboard the Busted Flush has never been so sweet. But suddenly, Gretel dies of an unidentified illness—or so he’s told. Convinced that the woman who stole his heart has been murdered, McGee finds himself pursuing a less-than-noble cause: revenge. “To diggers a thousand years from now, the works of John D. MacDonald would be a treasure on the order of the tomb of Tutankhamen.”—Kurt Vonnegut McGee has lost not only the love of his life but also his last hope for stability. Soon grief turns to blinding rage. So when he finds the people responsible for Gretel’s death, McGee goes off the rails—and off the grid, three thousand miles from home. McGee emerges in the California woods as Tom McGraw, a fisherman looking for his long-lost daughter. This mysterious newcomer starts knocking off targets one by one. But as he pursues his single-minded crusade for justice, he becomes more and more unhinged. McGee has spent his life saving other people, but now he’ll need to find the strength to save himself—before he loses his mind.
