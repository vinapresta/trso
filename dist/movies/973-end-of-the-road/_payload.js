It is around the startling results of Jake Horner's \"cure\" and its amazing mastermind--a doctor almost surely designed to become one of the most remarkable characters in modern fiction--that this brilliant, imaginative novel hinges.

The study of influence tends to centre on major authors and canonical works, identifying prior documents as sources or contexts for a given author. Intertextuality, on the other hand, is a concept unconcerned with authors as individuals; it treats all texts as part of a network of discourse that includes culture, history and social practices as well as other literary works. In thirteen essays drawing on the entire spectrum of English and American literary history, this volume considers the relationship between these two terms across the whole range of their usage.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=3bzpxp_FHj8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["John B Clayton"],firstBook:d,published:"1991-01-01",publisher:"Univ of Wisconsin Press",subtitle:a}},{id:5755,attributes:{title:"The Floating Opera and The End of the Road",description:"Tells the stories of a man's struggle with the idea of suicide and of a bed-hopping threesome brought together by a strange doctor-psychiatrist-mentor",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JjXuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:d,published:"1988-01-01",publisher:"Anchor",subtitle:a}},{id:5756,attributes:{title:"Theories of Play and Postmodern Fiction",description:"This volume traces the modern critical and performance history of this play, one of Shakespeare's most-loved and most-performed comedies.
