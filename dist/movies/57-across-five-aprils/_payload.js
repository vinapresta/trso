In 1861, America is on the cusp of war, and young Jethro Creighton is just nine-years-old. His brother, Tom, and his cousin, Eb, are both of fighting age. As Jethro's family is pulled into the conflict between the North and the South, loyalties are divided, dreams are threatened, and their bonds are put to the test in this heart-wrenching, coming of age story. “Drawing from family records and from stories told by her grandfather, the author has, in an uncommonly fine narrative, created living characters and vividly reconstructed a crucial period of history.”—Booklist","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=00nBNhFweJYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2002-01-08","Penguin"))
