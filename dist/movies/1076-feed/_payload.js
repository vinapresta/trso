Tom and Kate have managed to survive in an unconnected world, but the search for their abducted daughter reveals what they have lost. Without the Feed, no one knows who you are. No one knows who to trust. Without it, how can their daughter be saved? What readers are saying about The Feed: 'Absolutely terrifying. It is incredibly real and wholly recognisable' 'Gripping and exciting and all too close for comfort. Very realistic and beautifully written' 'A harrowing tale, at times moving, at times thoughtful, at times harsh. It will keep you coming back for more with characters that feel real, a vivid landscape and stellar thought-provoking story' 'This is not a book you can start reading and put back down so be prepared to lose some sleep over this one!'",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=B-prDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:n,publisher:"Hachette UK",subtitle:"A chilling, dystopian page-turner with a twist that will make your head explode"}},{id:6189,attributes:{title:e,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:k,publisher:l,subtitle:m}},{id:6190,attributes:{title:h,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2019-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069545714}}("movie","","Nick Clark Windo","series","The Feed",null,1,"Feed","“Think The Road intricately wrapped around Station Eleven with a dash of Oryx and Crake...Windo pushes all the right buttons in this post-apocalyptic mashup.” -- Kirkus Set in a post-apocalyptic world as unique and vividly imagined as those of Mad Max and The Girl with All the Gifts, a startling and timely debut that explores what it is to be human and what it truly means to be connected in the digital age. IT MAKES US. IT DESTROYS US. NOW WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT IT. The Feed is accessible everywhere, by everyone, at any time. It instantaneously links us to all information and global events as they break. Every interaction, every emotion, every image can be shared through it; it is the essential tool everyone relies on to know and understand the thoughts and feelings of partners, parents, friends, children, colleagues, bosses, employees . . . in fact, of anyone and everyone else in the world. Tom and Kate use the Feed, but Tom has resisted its addiction, which makes him suspect to his family. After all, his father created it. But that opposition to constant connection serves Tom and Kate well when the Feed collapses after a horrific tragedy shatters the world as they know it. The Feed’s collapse, taking modern society with it, leaves people scavenging to survive. Finding food is truly a matter of life and death. Minor ailments, previously treatable, now kill. And while the collapse has demolished the trappings of the modern world, it has also eroded trust. In a world where survival of the fittest is a way of life, there is no one to depend upon except yourself . . . and maybe even that is no longer true. Tom and Kate have managed to protect themselves and their family. But then their six-year-old daughter, Bea, goes missing. Who has taken her? How do you begin to look for someone in a world without technology? And what happens when you can no longer even be certain that the people you love are really who they claim to be?","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7IMnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2018-03-13","HarperCollins","A Novel","2018-01-25"))
