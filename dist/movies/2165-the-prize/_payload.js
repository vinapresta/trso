His book has been widely hailed as a unique portrait of a writer’s work. John Barkham, Saturday review syndicate: “How do novelists create works of fiction? The answer—better than any critic could hope to give it—is provided in this literary autopsy by Irving Wallace, one of the most widely read novelists of the day I cannot recall ever having read a laboratory report of this type before. No one interested in writing, editing, or just reading fiction should miss this professional postmortem. It ought to be made a standard text in writing schools.” NATIONAL OBSERVER: “Mr. Wallace, who kept journals and diaries at every stage of progress (in writing The Prize), has managed to make it all come alive for us, permitting us a sense of sharing in the making of the book.” CLEVELAND PRESS: “Wallace’s anatomy of a best seller is a fantastic record of almost total recall.” SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER: “The Writing of One Novel is an extremely valuable book for writers, and because its author is the eminently successful Irving Wallace it can be read avidly by a much wider circle of enthusiasts. Wallace is a best seller extraordinary and this present book is a comprehensive survey of how he came to write, how he wrote and how he was affected by the reception of The Prize The book seems utterly honest.” ST. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH: “Never before have I seen a successful writer tell so much about the ways of his work.” LOS ANGELES TIMES: “Irving Wallace’s candid and searching account of the conception, gestation and birth of The Prize... I found it a fascinating and revealing book... an excellent case study of what went into and came out in a single novel.”",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=icokEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:d,published:"2021-03-19",publisher:c,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377246817}}("","movie","Crossroad Press",null,"The Prize","Irving Wallace","series",1,"Novelist Andrew Craig has not been sober in a very long time. After losing his wife in an auto accident he believes to have been his own fault, he turned to the bottle, and to his sister-in-law, Leah, who acts as his caretaker and live-in nurse. Then, when he is awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for his novel, \"The Perfect State,\" a historical jab at communism, he heads for Stockholm, hoping to find a reason to live, and to write. The other laureates have their own problems, a heart surgeon who believes that sharing his award with an Italian colleague robs him of his glory, a married couple awarded the prize in medicine in the middle of a serious marital crisis, and others – including Max Stratman, whose heart isn't really up to the trip, but who needs the prize money to provide for niece, Emily. This novel delves into the lives, loves, dreams and nightmares of these characters, and others, building a panoramic view of the Nobel Prize, life in Stockholm, and the state of world politics in the years following World War II. It is rich and compelling, driving the reader from the pits of despair to the heights of inspiration. A wonderful novel by one of America's finest novelists. The Prize was made into a movie starring Paul Newman. SW: Six people all around the world are catapulted to international fame as they receive the most important telegraph of their lives, which invites them to Stockholm to receive the prize. This will result to be a turning point in their lives, in which personal affairs and political intrigue will engulf every one of the characters.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=bSH1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Irving wallace","1969-10-01"))
