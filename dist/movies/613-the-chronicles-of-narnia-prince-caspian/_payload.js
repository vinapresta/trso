Lewis (Illustrated)",description:"Clive Staples Lewis, better known as C.S. Lewis, was a respected academic, writer, and speaker. While he might be best known for his works of fantasy, especially the Chronicles of Narnia and Space Trilogy series, he also wrote many books on Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain. While Lewis was a lecturer at Oxford, he became close friends with fellow lecturer J.R.R. Tolkien, future author of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both authors participated in an informal writing group, The Inklings, where they critiqued and debated each other’s texts and ideas. His works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe stands out as his most popular fantasy work. Initially, the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia, though chronologically the second by order, it tells of the adventures of children who magically arrive in a magical country called Narnia. In Narnia, magic comes as no surprise, animals both speak and act, and good strives against evil. Lewis weaves Christian themes throughout the Chronicles of Narnia in a manner that is both accessible and picturesque for readers young and old. Attentive readers will also spot elements of Roman and Greek mythology as well as British and Irish folklore.
