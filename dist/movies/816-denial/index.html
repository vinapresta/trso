Lipstadt, a professor of Jewish Studies at Emory University, published the first comprehensive history of the Holocaust denial movement. In this critically acclaimed account, Lipstadt called David Irving ââ a prolific, respected, and wellâknown writer on World War II who had, over the years, made controversial statements about Hitler and the Jews ââ one of the most dangerous spokespersons of the denial movement. A year later, when Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin UK, for libel in a London courtroom, the media spotlight fell on Deborah Lipstadt and, by extension, on the historiography of the Holocaust. Five years later, when David Irving lost his case after an intense tenâweek trial, Lipstadt&#39;s resounding victory was proclaimed on front pages of newspapers worldwide. The implications of the trial, however, were far from over. History on Trial is Deborah Lipstadt&#39;s personal, riveting chronicle of the legal battle with Irving, in which she went from a relatively quiet existence as a professor at an American university to being a defendant in a sensational libel case. This blowâbyâblow account reveals how Lipstadt raised $1.5 million for her defense, which included a firstârate team of solicitors, historians, and experts, among them Anthony Julius, a literary scholar who is better known as the late Princess Diana&#39;s divorce lawyer. Lipstadt describes how in forced silence she endured Irving&#39;s relentless provocations, including his claims that more people died in Senator Kennedy&#39;s car at Chappaquiddick than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz, that survivors tattooed numbers on their arms to make money, and that nonwhite people are a different &quot;species.&quot; She also reveals how her lawyers gained access to Irving&#39;s personal papers, which exposed his association with neoâNazi extremists in Germany, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and the National Alliance, which wants to transform America into an &quot;Aryan society.&quot; In the course of the trial, Lipstadt&#39;s legal team stripped away Irving&#39;s mask of respectability through exposing the prejudice, extremism, and distortion of history that defined his work, even his once highly regarded account of the Dresden bombing. Part history, part edgeâofâyourâseat courtroom drama, History on Trial goes beyond the historiography of World War II and the Holocaust to reveal the intricate way in which extremism and deliberate historical distortions gain widespread legitimacy and help generate hatred. An inspiring personal story of perseverance and unexpected limelight, here is the definitive account of the trial that tested the standards for historical and judicial truths, a trial that the Daily Telegraph of London proclaimed did &quot;for the new century what the Nuremberg tribunals or the Eichmann trial did for earlier generations.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb5084"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=_yLm_cHp_REC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Denying the Holocaust" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Denying the Holocaust</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Deborah E.

Yet there are those who insist that the death of six million Jews in Nazi concentration camps is nothing but a hoax perpetrated by a powerful Zionist conspiracy. Sixty years ago, such notions were the province of pseudohistorians who argued that Hitler never meant to kill the Jews, and that only a few hundred thousand died in the camps from disease; they also argued that the Allied bombings of Dresden and other cities were worse than any Nazi offense, and that the Germans were the âtrue victimsâ of World War II. For years, those who made such claims were dismissed as harmless cranks operating on the lunatic fringe. But as time goes on, they have begun to gain a hearing in respectable arenas, and now, in the first full-scale history of Holocaust denial, Deborah Lipstadt shows howâdespite tens of thousands of living witnesses and vast amounts of documentary evidenceâthis irrational idea not only has continued to gain adherents but has become an international movement, with organized chapters, âindependentâ research centers, and official publications that promote a ârevisionistâ view of recent history. Lipstadt shows how Holocaust denial thrives in the current atmosphere of value-relativism, and argues that this chilling attack on the factual record not only threatens Jews but undermines the very tenets of objective scholarship that support our faith in historical knowledge. Thus the movement has an unsuspected power to dramatically alter the way that truth and meaning are transmitted from one generation to another.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb5085"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>History on Trial</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Deborah E.

In Holocaust: An American Understanding, renowned historian Deborah E. Lipstadt explores this striking evolution in Holocaust consciousness, revealing how a broad array of Americansâfrom students in middle schools to presidents of the United Statesâtried to make sense of this inexplicable disaster, and how they came to use the Holocaust as a lens to interpret their own history. Lipstadt weaves a powerful narrative that touches on events as varied as the civil rights movement, Vietnam, Stonewall, and the womenâs movement, as well as controversies over Bitburg, the Rwandan genocide, and the bombing of Kosovo. Drawing upon extensive research on politics, popular culture, student protests, religious debates and various strains of Zionist ideologies, Lipstadt traces how the Holocaust became integral to the fabric of American life. Even popular culture, including such films as Dr. Strangelove and such books as John Hersheyâs The Wall, was influenced by and in turn influenced thinking about the Holocaust. Equally important, the book shows how Americans used the Holocaust to make sense of what was happening in the United States. Many Americans saw the civil rights movement in light of Nazi oppression, for example, while others feared that American soldiers in Vietnam were destroying a people identified by the government as the enemy. Lipstadt demonstrates that the Holocaust became not just a tragedy to be understood but also a tool for interpreting America and its place in the world. Ultimately Holocaust: An American Understanding tells us as much about America in the years since the end of World War II as it does about the Holocaust itself.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODExNDEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg3NjIyOTE@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Denial" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Denial is based on the book History on Trial? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Based on the acclaimed book &quot;History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier,&quot; DENIAL recounts Deborah E. Lipstadt&#39;s (Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz) legal battle for historical truth against David Irving (Cannes Award winner Timothy Spall), who accused her of libel when she declared him a Holocaust denier. In the English legal system in Defamation, the burden of proof is on the accused, therefore it was up to Lipstadt and her legal team to prove the essential truth that the Holocaust occurred. Also starring two-time Academy Award nominee Tom Wilkinson, the film is directed by Emmy Award winner Mick Jackson (&quot;Temple Grandin&quot;) and adapted for the screen by BAFTA and Academy Award nominated writer David Hare (THE READER).
