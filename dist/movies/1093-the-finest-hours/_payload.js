Tougias and Casey Sherman tells the story of the shipwreck of two oil tankers and the harrowing Coast Guard rescue when four men in a tiny lifeboat overcame insurmountable odds and saved more than 30 stranded sailors. Now a major motion picture from Disney, starring Chris Pine and Casey Affleck. On the night of February 18, 1952, during one of the worst winter storms that New England has ever seen, two oil tankers just off the shore of Cape Cod were torn in half. With the storm in full force and waves up to 70 feet high, four coast guardsmen headed out to sea in a tiny lifeboat to come to the rescue. They were the only hope for the stranded sailors. Despite incredible obstacles, these brave men risked their lives, remembering the unofficial Coast Guard motto: You have to go out, but you do not have to come back. This is a fast-paced, uplifting story that puts young readers in the middle of the action. It's a gripping true tale of heroism and survival in the face of the elements.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Go8gnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,h],firstBook:true,published:"2015-12-08",publisher:"Square Fish",subtitle:"The True Story of a Heroic Sea Rescue"}},{id:889,attributes:{title:g,description:"The true story of an incredible disaster and heroic rescue at sea told by two masterful storytellers In the winter of 1952, New England was battered by the most brutal nor'easter in years. As the weather wreaked havoc on land, the freezing Atlantic became a wind-whipped zone of peril. In the early hours of Monday, February 18, while the storm raged, two oil tankers, the Pendleton and the Fort Mercer, found themselves in the same horrifying predicament. Built with \"dirty steel,\" and not prepared to withstand such ferocious seas, both tankers split in two, leaving the dozens of men on board utterly at the Atlantic's mercy. The Finest Hours is the gripping, true story of the valiant attempt to rescue the souls huddling inside the broken halves of the two ships. Coast Guard cutters raced to the aid of those on the Fort Mercer, and when it became apparent that the halves of the Pendleton were in danger of capsizing, the Guard sent out two thirty-six-foot lifeboats as well. These wooden boats, manned by only four seamen, were dwarfed by the enormous seventy-foot seas. As the tiny rescue vessels set out from the coast of Cape Cod, the men aboard were all fully aware that they were embarking on what could easily become a suicide mission. The spellbinding tale is overflowing with breathtaking scenes that sear themselves into the mind's eye, as boats capsize, bows and sterns crash into one another, and men hurl themselves into the raging sea in their terrifying battle for survival. Not all of the eighty-four men caught at sea in the midst of that brutal storm survived, but considering the odds, it's a miracle -- and a testament to their bravery -- that any came home to tell their tales at all. Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman have seamlessly woven together their extensive research and firsthand interviews to create an unforgettable tale of heroism, triumph, and tragedy, one that truly tells of the Coast Guard's finest hours.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QwRvlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,h],firstBook:c,published:"2009-05-19",publisher:"Scribner",subtitle:"The True Story of the U.S. Coast Guard's Most Daring Sea Rescue"}},{id:890,attributes:{title:"A Storm Too Soon",description:"Presents the story of three men shipwrecked during a storm in the Gulf Stream and the four men on a Coast Guard helicopter who rescued them, as survivors and rescuers battle monster waves and perilous wind conditions.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nnJ1AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,i],firstBook:c,published:"2014-01-07",publisher:d,subtitle:"A True Story of Disaster, Survival and an Incredible Rescue"}},{id:891,attributes:{title:"Rescue of the Bounty",description:"In this suspenseful story of the human will to survive, the captain of the HMS Bounty, the actual replica used in the 1962 remake of the 1935 classic Mutiny on the Bounty, recounts his harrowing encounter with Hurricane Sandy that resulted in the death of two crew members.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=LaMqAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,"Douglas A.
