Delaney solves a string of murder cases in these first two novels in the series by the #1 New York Times–bestselling author. Lawrence Sanders’s first novel in the Deadly Sins series became a New York Times bestseller and was made into an acclaimed film starring Frank Sinatra as hard-bitten New York City homicide detective Edward X.
