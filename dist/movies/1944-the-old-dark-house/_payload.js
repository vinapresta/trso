Priestley's books. He was the last of his kind.' - Stan Barstow 'J.B. Priestley is one of our literary icons of the 20th century. And it is time that we all became re-acquainted with his genius.' - Dame Judi Dench Philip and Margaret Waverton and their friend Roger Penderel are driving through the mountains of Wales when a torrential downpour washes away the road and forces them to seek shelter for the night. They take refuge in an ancient, crumbling mansion inhabited by the strange and sinister Femm family and their brutish servant Morgan. Determined to make the best of the circumstances, the benighted travellers drink, talk, and play games to pass the time while the storm rages outside. But as the night progresses and tensions rise, dangerous and unexpected secrets emerge. On the house's top floor are two locked doors; behind one of them lies the mysterious, unseen Sir Roderick Femm, and behind the other lurks an unspeakable terror. Which is more deadly: the apocalyptic storm outside the house or the unknown horrors that await within? And will any of them survive the night? \"Benighted\" (1927), a classic 'old dark house' novel of psychological terror, was the second novel by J. B. Priestley (1894-1984), better known for his classics \"The Good Companions\" (1929), \"Angel Pavement\" (1930) and \"Bright Day\" (1946). The basis for James Whale's 1932 film \"The Old Dark House,\" \"Benighted\" returns to print for the first time in fifty years.

They are not only examples of narrative skill, but exhibitions of social truth.\" - \" Saturday Review\" \"Priestley is one of the finest and most popular storytellers of the last hundred years. We are now aware many of his stories have a prophetic quality.\" - Dame Margaret Drabble \"[H]ighly readable and provocative.\" - \"Sunday Herald (Sydney)\" J. B. Priestley (1894-1984) was a versatile and prolific novelist and playwright, but in \"The Other Place\" (1953), he shows an unexpected talent, proving himself a master of the weird tale. In \"The Grey Ones,\" Mr. Patson visits a psychiatrist after he becomes convinced that a race of demons masquerading as men are plotting the overthrow of the human race . . . but what if he's not insane? In \"Guest of Honour,\" a banquet speech becomes a horrifying affair when the keynote speaker realizes his audience is made up of monstrous and menacing creatures. \"The Leadington Incident\" recounts the disturbing experience of a Cabinet minister who suddenly perceives that though the people around him move and talk as though alive, they are all actually just animated corpses or sleepwalking zombies. The nine tales in this collection are strange, fantastic, and often unsettling, and they represent Priestley at his best. This 60th anniversary edition, the first reprinting of \"The Other Place\" in more than forty years, includes a new introduction by Priestley scholar John Baxendale.
