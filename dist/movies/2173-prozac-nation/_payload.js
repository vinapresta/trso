When her all-night, drug-fueled writing binges and emotional instability alienate her roommate and best friend, Ruby (Michelle Williams), as well as both her first (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and second (Jason Biggs) boyfriends, Lizzie seeks psychiatric counseling from Dr. Diana Sterling (Anne Heche), who prescribes the wonder drug Prozac. Despite success as a writer that includes a gig writing for Rolling Stone and some mellowing out thanks to her medication, Lizzie begins to feel that the pills are running her life and faces some tough choices about her future.",slug:"prozac-nation"}}},books:{data:[{id:10711,attributes:{title:a,description:d,thumbnail:e,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:f,publisher:g,subtitle:h}},{id:10712,attributes:{title:a,description:d,thumbnail:e,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:f,publisher:g,subtitle:h}},{id:10713,attributes:{title:a,description:"'Prozac Nation' gives voice to the high incidence of depression amongst young people who are fully entrenched in the culture of divorce, economic instability and AIDS.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Yszw2AdqOYIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:i,subtitle:"Young & Depressed in America : a Memoir"}},{id:10714,attributes:{title:"Radical Sanity",description:"Miss Wurtzel is back, and this time she's armed with advice for the modern woman. She's found the secret of life, and it's within everyone's reach. It's about enjoying your mistakes. It's about being strong. It's about eating dessert. It's about having opinions. It's about adoring feminism. It's about embracing fanaticism. It's also about saying your prayers, not overpacking, and making your boyfriend do the dishes.. Some of her words of wisdom: - Think Productively: It's not that you have to see it to believe it; on the contrary, you have to believe it to see it. - Be Gorgeous: I myself believe that I am about ten times prettier than I actually am. By dint of sheer will power, I have managed to convince many people of this. - Enjoy Your Single Years: Do not think that the whole point of being single is being married; men don't think this way, and neither should you. In Radical Sanity, these lessons, and many more, are delivered with the sharp wit and candor we've come to expect -- and love -- from Elizabeth Wurtzel.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SARL1ZrkzSAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2001-01-23",publisher:"AtRandom",subtitle:"Commonsense Advice for Uncommon People"}},{id:10715,attributes:{title:"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions",description:"\"A guide to references commonly used in speech and writing.
