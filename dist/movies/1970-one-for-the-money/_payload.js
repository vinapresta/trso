Here’s where it all began—the three novels that first brought us Stephanie Plum, that bounty hunter with attitude who stepped out of Trenton’s blue-collar “burg” and into the heart of America. One for the Money: Stephanie’s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad and doing her best to sever the world’s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There’s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase is interesting. Two for the Dough: Stephanie takes to the mean streets of Trenton, armed with attitude (not to mention stun guns and defense sprays), to find Kenny Mancuso, who recently shot his best friend and is on the run. Aided by the enigmatic Ranger, who knows a thing or two about bounty hunting, and by her irrepressible Grandma Mazur, Stephanie forms a shaky alliance with her favorite cop, Joe Morelli, for a tumultuous chase through back alleys and Grandma's favorite funeral parlors. Three to Get Deadly: Stephanie is having a bad hair day—for the whole month of January. She’s looking for Mo Bedemier, Trenton’s most beloved citizen, who was charged with carrying concealed and skipped bail. To help her, she’s got Lula, a former hooker turned file clerk. Big, blonde, and black, Lula’s itching to lock up a crook in the trunk of her car. And Morelli, the cop with the slow-burning smile, is acting polite even after Stephanie finds more bodies than the Trenton PD has seen in years. That’s a bad sign for sure. Funny and fabulous, Janet Evanovich is at her sparkling best in these three novels that launched a bestselling phenomenon.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yv9kavaIDOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2011-08-23",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:"One for the Money, Two for the Dough, Three to Get Deadly"}},{id:9888,attributes:{title:a,description:"The dynamite blockbuster from Janet Evanovich that started it all—now a major motion picture starring Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum! ONE FINE MESS Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store). Stephanie needs cash—fast—but times are tough, and soon she's forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family... ONE FALSE MOVE Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie's bail bonding company. She's got no experience. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice cop Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father's Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water—wanted for murder... ONE FOR THE MONEY Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prizefighter Benito Ramirez isn't. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she'll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight—and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...",thumbnail:c,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2003-04-14",publisher:"St. Martin's Paperbacks",subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940950354}}("One for the Money","Janet Evanovich","",null,"Now available in a special 25th anniversary edition!

Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey.
