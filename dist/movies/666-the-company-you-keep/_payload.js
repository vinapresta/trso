Spearheading this vast undertaking were crack British and American airborne forces. The Day The Devils Dropped In examines in fascinating detail the pivotal role of the 9th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment over the first week of the landings. Tasked with neutralizing the mighty Merville Battery, capturing Le Plein and the Château St Côme on the Breville Ridge, failure by the Paras to achieve any of these key objectives could well have unraveled the whole OVERLORD operation with catastrophic consequences. In his quest to uncover the true story of the early days of the landings, Neil Barber has successfully tracked down surviving participants in the operation. As a result he is able to tell the full story of the fierce fighting that characterized the early days of the landings largely in the very words of those who lived through the experience. This adds much to the credibility and immediacy of this enthralling book, which paints a superb picture of what soldiers care to call 'the fog of war'. The result is an inspiring and revealing read and a fine tribute to those whose contribution must never be forgotten.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iuWwBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Neil Barber"],firstBook:e,published:"2008-10-17",publisher:"Pen and Sword",subtitle:"The 9th Parachute Battalion in Normandy - D-Day to D+6"}},{id:4488,attributes:{title:"Sacrifice of Isaac",description:"After the death of his Israeli statesman father, Luke Benami is forced by the terms of his inheritance to locate his estranged brother, a political exile, and becomes embroiled in the illegal antiquities market.

It started conventionally enough: she was the daughter of an actress and a lawyer, living in small-town America. But this was all shattered when, as a seven-year-old, she was abandoned by her father in a New York hotel room and everything she knew fell apart. Her father, it turned out, wasn't the man he said he was, but was actually one of America's most wanted fugitives, owing to his involvement in a notorious bank robbery. You're A Big Girl Now picks up the story some years later. Isabel is now a 27 year-old tech-savvy, freelance investigative journalist, one of the USA's best, despite some self-medication problems. She decides to turn her skills on her own family in the hope of finally understanding the truth about her grandfather, her father and everything that's happened to her.
