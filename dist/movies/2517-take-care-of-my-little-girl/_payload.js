Bill and Angela Priest are dead, and Willow, still struggling to control the flashbacks from her last assignment in Iraq, has somehow landed in the middle of their living room holding an open cell phone dialing 911 and soaked in a lapful of Angela's blood. She leaves the Society Hill house with Angela's diamond ring, an old surfboard depicting clues to the whereabouts of an even rarer diamond, and way too many gaps in her memory. To fill in the blanks, Willow heads to Hawaii. Before long she finds herself immersed in the massive waves of the Bonzai Pipeline and the manic lives of the surfers who live and work there. As the murders pile up and the competition for Pipe Master's Crown heats up, Willow begins to doubt everyone involvedincluding herself.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=quwFDYPTqoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Peggy Farrell"],firstBook:c,published:"2010-10-27",publisher:"iUniverse",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940914781}}("","Peggy Goodin",null,"Take Care of My Little Girl","\"\"Take Care Of My Little Girl\", A Novel by Peggy Goodin.\"--","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BcJAAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1950-01-01"))
