Best known for the now-classic 1934 novel Appointment in Samarra and such blockbuster bestsellers as Ten North Frederick and Butterfield 8, in a career spanning four decades John O'Hara also published numerous story collections. Among his finest work, they highlight qualities that sold more than 15 million copies of his books in the course of his career: the snappy dialogue, the telling detail, the ironic narrative twist. Like the novels, and like the much-praised collection of John O'Hara's Gibbsville stories, also edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, the selections in John O'Hara's Hollywood, many originally appearing in the New Yorker or the Saturday Evening Post, explore the materialist aspirations and sexual exploits of flawed, prodigally human characters for whom arrangements consitute a deal and compromises pass for love.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iuBlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2007-01-01",publisher:"Da Capo Press, Incorporated",subtitle:a}},{id:12216,attributes:{title:"Selected Short Stories of John O'Hara",description:"\"John O'Hara's fiction,\" wrote Lionel Trilling, \"is preeminent for its social verisimilitude.\" Made famous by his bestselling novels, including BUtterfield 8 and Appointment in Samarra, O'Hara (1905-1970) also wrote some of the finest short fiction of the twentieth century. First published by the Modern Library in 1956, Selected Short Stories of John O'Hara displays the author's skills as a keen social observer, a refreshingly frank storyteller, and a writer with a brilliant ear for dialogue. \"The stories in this volume,\" writes Louis Begley in his new Introduction, \"show the wide range of [O'Hara's] interests and an ability to treat with a virtuoso's ease characters and situations from any place on America's geographic and social spectrum.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=t4gqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1956-01-01",publisher:"Random House Incorporated",subtitle:a}},{id:12217,attributes:{title:"Selected Letters of John O'Hara",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jJWZAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1978-01-01",publisher:"New York : Random House",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309134461}}("","John O'Hara","movie",null,"Ten North Frederick","series",1,"The National Book Award–winning novel by the writer whom Fran Lebowitz called “the real F. Scott Fitzgerald” Joe Chapin led a storybook life. A successful small-town lawyer with a beautiful wife, two over-achieving children, and aspirations to be president, he seemed to have it all. But as his daughter looks back on his life, a different man emerges: one in conflict with his ambitious and shrewish wife, terrified that the misdeeds of his children will dash his political dreams, and in love with a model half his age. With black wit and penetrating insight, Ten North Frederick stands with Richard Yates’ Revolutionary Road, Evan S. Connell’s Mr. Bridge and Mrs. Bridge, the stories of John Cheever, and Mad Men as a brilliant portrait of the personal and political hypocrisy of mid-century America.
