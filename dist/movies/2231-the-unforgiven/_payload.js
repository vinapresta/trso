Ben Zachary, the head of the family following the death of his father, Will Zachary, in Ben being the oldest son, and patriarch Zeb Rawlins are partners in a cattle ranching operation. Zeb's unassuming son Charlie Rawlins would like to court Ben's younger sister, adopted Rachel Zachary - something that doesn't quite sit well with Ben in he believing Charlie not worthy of Rachel - while Zeb's daughter Georgia Rawlins would be happy with any of the Zachary brothers, although she has her sights set on middle son Cash Zachary. Their world is upset with the arrival of an older man brandishing a saber. It is not the saber which is concerning, but rather the story that he is spreading: that Rachel is of Indian heritage, most specifically Kiowa. Regardless of the truth, which matriarch Mattilda Zachary knows, this story places a strain on the community who don't want a \"dirty Injun\" in their midst, threatens all the relationships between the Zacharys and Rawlins, and causes a division within the Zachary family, as the Zacharys try to protect themselves and their property against those who don't want Rachel there, including the Kiowa who want Rachel, one of their own, back.",slug:"the-unforgiven"}}},books:{data:[{id:10922,attributes:{title:c,description:"\"The Texas Panhandle was a harsh and unforgiving place, but the Zachary family managed to get by.

But his short stories are no less memorable. Beginning in the 1920s, LeMay was a frequent contributor of Western stories to magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. The best of these stories, unavailable for many years, are collected here. Among the selections is \"The Little Kid,\" perhaps LeMay's most touching story, a poignant tale of a young boy who is orphaned when his father is killed on a cattle drive.

Slambang! --The New York Times on John Ford's The Searchers John Ford's The Searchers defined the spirit of America, influenced a generation of film makers, and was named the Greatest Western Movie of All Time by the American Film Institute in 2008. Now, the novel that gave birth to the film returns to print--a timeless work of vivid, raw western fiction and a no-holds-barred portrait of the real American frontier. From the moment they left their homestead unguarded on that scorching Texas day, Martin Pauley and Amos Edwards became searchers. First they had to return to the decimated ranch, bury the bodies of their family, and confront the evil cunning of the Comanche who had slaughtered them. Then they set out in pursuit of missing Debbie Edwards. In the years that follow, Amos and Martin survive storms of nature and of men, seeking more than a missing girl, and more than revenge. Both are driven by secrets, guilt, love, and rage. Defying the dangers all around them, two men become a frontier legend, searching for the one moment, and the one last battle, that will finally set them free. . . \"As brashly entertaining as they come.\" --New York Times \"Epic. . .a drama of stubborn courage to which the prose lends a matching stature.\" --Kirkus Reviews Alan Le May was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and attended Stetson University in DeLand, Florida in 1916.
