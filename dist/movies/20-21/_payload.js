But as fellow card counter, Jill Taylor, predicts, Ben becomes corrupted by greed and his arrogance at winning which lets his feelings get in the way, and it also puts Professor Rosa, as well as the group, on the radar of a brutal casino security enforcer, named Cole Williams, who holds a personal grudge of some kind against Rosa which threatens to undo everything the students have learned and earned.",slug:f}}},books:{data:[{id:1809,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}},{id:1810,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:l}},{id:1811,attributes:{title:m,description:"After five weeks on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list in hardcover, Mezrich's inside story of the young card-counting masterminds who took on Vegas is poised to reach an even wider audience in its new paperback edition.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rbDe2kf7gfYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2004-01-01",publisher:"Gardners Books",subtitle:"How Six Students Took Vegas for Millons"}},{id:1812,attributes:{title:m,description:"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YZdiPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2003-10-01",publisher:"Arrow",subtitle:"The Inside Story of Six M.

Ben Mezrich's 2009 bestseller The Accidental Billionaires is the definitive account of Facebook's founding and the basis for the Academy Award–winning film The Social Network. Two of the story's iconic characters are Harvard students Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss: identical twins, Olympic rowers, and foils to Mark Zuckerberg. Bitcoin Billionaires is the story of the brothers’ redemption and revenge in the wake of their epic legal battle with Facebook. Planning to start careers as venture capitalists, the brothers quickly discover that no one will take their money after their fight with Zuckerberg. While nursing their wounds in Ibiza, they accidentally run into an eccentric character who tells them about a brand-new idea: cryptocurrency. Immersing themselves in what is then an obscure and sometimes sinister world, they begin to realize “crypto” is, in their own words, \"either the next big thing or total bulls--t.\" There’s nothing left to do but make a bet. From the Silk Road to the halls of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bitcoin Billionaires will take us on a wild and surprising ride while illuminating a tantalizing economic future. On November 26, 2017, the Winklevoss brothers became the first bitcoin billionaires. Here’s the story of how they got there—as only Ben Mezrich could tell it.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=IrZrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2019-05-21",publisher:"Flatiron Books",subtitle:"A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531246775}}("movie","Ben Mezrich","series",null,1,"21","21 Bringing Down the House","Recounts the story of how a notorious gang of MIT blackjack savants devised and received backing for a system for winning at the world's most sophisticated casinos, an endeavor that earned them more than three million dollars.
