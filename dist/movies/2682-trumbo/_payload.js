Soon to be a major motion picture starring BRYAN CRANSTON (Breaking Bad), DIANE LANE (Under The Tuscan Sun), ELLE FANNING (Maleficent), JOHN GOODMAN (Argo), LOUIS C.K. (Louie) and Academy Award winner HELEN MIRREN. Dalton Trumbo was the central figure of the infamous 'Hollywood Ten,' the screenwriters who, during the McCarthy era, were charged by the House Committee on Un-American Acitivities for their associations with the Communist Party. Due to their refusal to cooperate during the investigation, Trumbo and his fellow screenwriters were declared in contempt of Congress and were ultimately blacklisted from Hollywood and some were even jailed. Although Trumbo was one of several hundred writers, directors, producers, and actors who were deprived of the opportunity to work in the motion picture industry from 1947 to 1960, he won an Oscar under the pseudonym Robert Rich for The Brave One in 1956, and he was the first to see his name on the big screen again in 1960 with Exodus, one of the year's biggest movies. All his life Trumbo was a radical of the homegrown, independent variety. From his early days in Colorado, where his grandfather was a county sheriff, to his time in Los Angeles, where he organized a bakery strike and was even a bootlegger, to his time as an author when he wrote the powerful pacifist novel Johnny Got His Gun, to his heyday as a top-paid (and frequently broke) Hollywood screenwriter-where his credits include Roman Holiday, Spartacus, Papillon, Lonely Are the Brave, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, The Brave One, and Kitty Foyle-his life rivaled anything he had created. Written with Dalton Trumbo's full cooperation, at a moment when he himself did not know how much time he had left, Trumbo is a candid tale of a colorful figure who was at the epicenter of a tumultuous period in recent American history.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OlEWswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:e,publisher:"Two Roads",subtitle:"A biography of the Oscar-winning screenwriter who broke the Hollywood blacklist"}},{id:12833,attributes:{title:f,description:g,thumbnail:h,authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:i,publisher:j,subtitle:b}},{id:12834,attributes:{title:"Brecht in Exile",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HEsPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"1983-01-01",publisher:"New York : Holt, Rinehart and Winston",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940903183}}("Bruce Cook","",null,"Trumbo","2015-09-08","Dalton Trumbo","\"A biography of the Oscar-winning screenwriter who broke the Hollywood blacklist\"--Dust jacket.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=AJtbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1977-01-01","Scribner Book Company"))
