Still struggling with his inner demons, Kane is particularly intrigued by the psychotic former astronaut, Captain Cutshaw, whose metaphysical enquiries trigger a feverish recurring nightmare. More and more, as Kane and Cutshaw engage in intense theological debates over the existence of God and evil, the troubled scientist finds himself at a dead-end, in need of a brilliant but reckless plan to determine the root of the soldiers' complex mental breakdowns.

Have the men truly lost their minds, are they only pretending to be insane to avoid combat, or is some more sinister conspiracy at work? Desperate for answers, the Pentagon has placed a brilliant Marine psychiatrist in charge of the base and its deranged occupants. A man of deep faith and compassion, Colonel Kane hopes to uncover the root of the men's bizarre obsessions. But as Center Eighteen descends into chaos, Kane finds the greatest challenge may be his own buried demons. . . . The basis of an acclaimed 1980 film (also known as Twinkle, Twinkle, \"Killer\" Kane), William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration is a thought-provoking, blackly comic journey into the heart of madness—and the outer limits of belief.
