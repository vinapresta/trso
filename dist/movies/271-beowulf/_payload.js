Wellek and Warren looked at literature as both a social product--influenced by politics, economics, etc.--as well as a self-contained system of formal structures. Incorporating examples from Aristotle to Coleridge, written in clear, uncondescending prose, Theory of Literature is a work which, especially in its suspicion of simplistic explanations and its distrust of received wisdom, remains extremely relevant to the study of literature today.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CQ6xtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Rene Wellek","Austin Warren"],firstBook:d,published:"2018-09-10",publisher:"Scholarly",subtitle:b}},{id:2876,attributes:{title:"The Routledge Dictionary of Literary Terms",description:"Examines the significance and history of a wide range of terms and phrases related to the analysis of literature.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Q9Pc12Ty8zsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Peter Childs","Roger Fowler"],firstBook:d,published:"2006-01-01",publisher:"Taylor & Francis",subtitle:b}},{id:2877,attributes:{title:"Attributing Authorship",description:"Recent literary scholarship has seen a shift of interest away from questions of attribution. Yet these questions remain urgent and important for any historical study of writing, and have been given a powerful new impetus by advances in statistical studies of language and the coming on line of large databases of texts in machine-searchable form. The present book is the first comprehensive survey of the field from a literary perspective to appear for forty years. It covers both traditional and computer based approaches to attribution, and evaluates each in respect of their potentialities and limitations. It revisits a number of famous controversies, including those concerning the authorship of the Homeric poems, books from the Old and New Testaments, and the plays of Shakespeare. Written with wit as well as erudition Attributing Authorship will make this intriguing field accessible for students and scholars alike.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=EBAUdyBN_6kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Harold Love"],firstBook:d,published:"2002-06-20",publisher:"Cambridge University Press",subtitle:"An Introduction"}},{id:2878,attributes:{title:"Outline of American Literature",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WHeYRAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Kathryn Van Spanckeren"],firstBook:d,published:"2009-09-01",publisher:"Orange Groove Books",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531270581}}("movie","","series",null,1))
