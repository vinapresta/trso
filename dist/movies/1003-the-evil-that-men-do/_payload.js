Alphabetical entries list film or episode, complete cast and credits, and year of release. Accompanying each entry’s plot synopsis and discussion is a survey of the critical responses to the work. The great Charles Laughton once said Bronson “has the strongest face in the business, and he is also one of its best actors.” Pretty high praise for an actor who, though loved by fans worldwide, has been consistently underestimated by critics. Bronson’s career has spanned five decades, from such television appearances in The Fugitive, Rawhide, Bonanza and Have Gun, Will Travel as well as the telemovie A Family of Cops (1995) and its two sequels. He will long be remembered for his role as urban vigilante Paul Kersey in the Death Wish films.
