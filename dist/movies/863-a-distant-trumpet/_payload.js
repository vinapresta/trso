Lamy’s accomplishments, including the endowing of hospitals, orphanages, and English-language schools and colleges, formed the foundation of modern-day Santa Fe and often brought him into conflict with corrupt local priests. His life story, also the subject of Willa Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop, describes a pivotal period in the American Southwest, as Spanish and Mexican rule gave way to much greater influence from the U.S. and Europe. Historian and consummate stylist Paul Horgan has given us a chronicle filled with hardy, often extraordinary adventure, and sustained by Lamy’s magnificent strength of character.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=zQFqnf05vlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2012-05-01",publisher:g,subtitle:f}},{id:5293,attributes:{title:"A Certain Climate",description:"Essays discuss American history, science and art, Willa Cather, Henriette Wyeth, and Rouben Mamoulian",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=8BJ9kpQdbD0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1988-06-01",publisher:g,subtitle:"Essays in History, Arts, and Letters"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069508648}}("movie","Paul Horgan","series",null,"A Distant Trumpet","","Wesleyan University Press",1,"Tells of a company of U.S. cavalry in Arizona in the 1880s, and their part in the wars against the Chiricahua Apaches.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GVLvKkV_xY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1991-01-01","David R.
