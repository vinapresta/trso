Higgins’ chilling tour de force about deceit, blackmail and the importance of paying one’s dues. Ultimate recidivist Earl Beale has learnt little from his early release from jail and narrow escape from being drafted, seemingly nothing can cure him of his criminal ways. Obsessed by money, and with a keen eye for scheming, he’s the kind of car salesman no one can trust. When suddenly some unfinished business from his past catches up with him, it’s dubitable whether he’s going to successfully extricate himself from this one.

Calculating, ruthless, businesslike, and with a shrewd sense of other people's weaknesses, Cogan plies his trade, moving among a variety of hoods, hangers-on, and big-timers, tracking those responsible, and returning \"law and order\" to the lawless Boston underworld.
