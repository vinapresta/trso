A charismatic priest, Father Flynn, is trying to upend the school's strict customs, which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the iron-gloved Principal who believes in the power of fear-based discipline. The winds of political change are sweeping through the community, and indeed, the school has just accepted its first black student, Donald Miller. But when Sister James, a hopeful innocent, shares with Sister Aloysius her guilt-inducing suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald, Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now, without a shard of proof besides her moral certainty, Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with irrevocable consequences.",slug:"doubt"}}},books:{data:[{id:5407,attributes:{title:h,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:k,publisher:c,subtitle:d}},{id:5408,attributes:{title:"Prodigal Son (TCG Edition)",description:"'What I admire most is that his plays are beautifully well made, economical, sharp and coherent. He's not a misanthrope, but he's in pursuit of why people behave as badly as they do along with having a great compassion for them. That's an unusual and interesting combination.'—Tony Kushner, on John Patrick Shanley When a troubled but gifted boy from the South Bronx finds himself shipped off to a private school in New Hampshire, the adjustment to the alien environment will lead to his ultimate dissolution or redemption. Teachers in the affluent institution do not know what to make of the new boisterous student, though the challenge really lies in his self-perception. Like his most celebrated play, Doubt, the author has based this new work on his own personal experiences of growing up as a teenager in the South Bronx and his time spent at a prep school in New England. Shanley has created an elemental study of a young's man search for his place in the world. John Patrick Shanley's plays include Outside Mullingar, Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, Savage in Limbo, and Dirty Story, along with his \"Church and State\" trilogy, Doubt, Defiance, and Storefront Church. For his play Doubt, he received both the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He has nine films to his credit, including the five-time Oscar-nominated Doubt, and Moonstruck, which received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

In this very Irish story with a surprising depth of poetic passion, these yearning, eccentric souls fight their way towards solid ground and happiness. Their journey is heartbreaking, funny as hell, and ultimately, deeply moving. Set in the Irish countryside, Outside Mullingar has been dubbed the \"Irish Moonstruck\" and will premiere on Broadway in 2014, starring Debra Messing and Brian F. O'Byrne and helmed by Doug Hughes, the Tony Award–winning director of Doubt. John Patrick Shanley is from the Bronx. His plays include Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, Savage in Limbo, and Dirty Story. His trilogy Church and State began with Doubt, followed by Defiance and Storefront Church. For his play Doubt, the playwright received both the Tony Award and the Pulitzer Prize. He has nine films to his credit, including the five-time Oscar-nominated Doubt with Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. Other films include Five Corners, Alive, Joe Versus The Volcano, and Live From Baghdad for HBO (Emmy nomination).

Mr. Shanley has expanded his focus from the intimate to the international to create one of the liveliest, boldest and—against the odds—funniest studies ever of a subject that even hard-core satirists tend to approach on tiptoe.”—Ben Brantley, The New York Times Three new works by Pulitzer Prize–winning author John Patrick Shanley, one of our country’s most politically current and theatrically elastic playwrights. In Dirty Story a couple of sadomasochistic writers fight over rights to their New York City loft, in this sexy satire of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is “astonishing,” says Tony Kushner, “The analysis of the Middle East in this play is dead on, exactly perfectly pitched.” In his dark comedy Where’s My Money? Shanley takes on marriage, infidelity and divorce lawyers in a play that is “so harsh, it’s funny—terrifying, but funny,” (The New York Times). And in his Sailor’s Song, love becomes an act of courage, in this seaside romance about the certainty of death, the brevity of youth, and the importance of now. John Patrick Shanley’s Doubt won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play, and was chosen as best play of the year by over 10 newspapers and magazines. His other plays include Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, Four Dogs and a Bone, Psychopathia Sexualis and Savage Limbo.
