But Alma doesn't fit into her daughter's political-hostess life even for a visit, and she finds more sympathy in her granddaughter. Alma, in a burst of rebellion, buys a supercharged hotrod and sets out on a voyage of self-discovery to Melbourne--if she can remember to stay on the left side of the road. Along the way, she meets con artists, gangsters, and a ponytailed white-knight in a camper and she finds not only adventure and romance, but also the courage to go back and face her relationship with her daughter and set it right.",slug:"over-the-hill"}}},books:{data:[{id:9999,attributes:{title:"Alone in the Australian Outback",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Gladys Taylor","Jeff Burgess"],firstBook:true,published:"1984-01-01",publisher:"Calgary : Deadwood Pub.",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940948056}}(""))
