In this cautionary rhyming tale, we learn of the Once-ler, who came across a valley of Truffula Trees and Brown Bar-ba-loots (“frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as they played in the shade and ate Truffula Fruits”), and how his harvesting of the tufted trees changed the landscape forever. With the release of the blockbuster film version, the Lorax and his classic tale have educated a new generation of young readers not only about the importance of seeing the beauty in the world around us, but also about our responsibility to protect it. This Read & Listen edition contains audio narration.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kbw4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2013-09-24"))
