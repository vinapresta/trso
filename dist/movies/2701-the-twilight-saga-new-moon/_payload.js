La ragazza vive un lungo periodo di solitudine e tristezza, in cui taglia i ponti con le proprie amicizie e si rinchiude in se stessa, fino alla quasi casuale riapparizione nella sua vita di Jacob Black, il giovane indiano Quileute che per primo aveva fatto nascere in lei i dubbi sulla vera identità dei Cullen.
