Will Prendick survive and recover from the horrors he has seen? Will anyone believe him? In this classic early science-fiction novel, H.G. Wells exposes the anxieties of the Victorian Age: fearing the implications of evolutionary theory, disturbed by the godlike power of science over nature, & doubtful about the inevitability of human progress. Might humans be capable of degeneration? The Island of Dr. Moreau raises vital questions about bioethics, animal rights, & the nature of humanity.

G. Wells",description:"Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life. While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7_RJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:b,published:"2021-10-23",publisher:"BEYOND BOOKS HUB",subtitle:a}},{id:8595,attributes:{title:"The Island of Doctor Moreau and Other Stories",description:"This volume unites four of Wells' liveliest and most engaging tales of the strange evolution and behaviour of animals - including human beings.
