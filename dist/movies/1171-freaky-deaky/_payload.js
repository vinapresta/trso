He’s fast becoming an authentic American icon.” No matter where you wish to place the man who created the character of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, lately of TV’s hit series Justified, in the pantheon of mystery and noir detective fiction demigods—John D.

It was during the 1980s that Elmore Leonard came into his own as the most popular and critically acclaimed crime writer in America. The four novels collected here show him at the top of his form, each in its own distinct way: City Primeval is a modern-day Western pitched on the border between law and lawlessness, with Detroit as the frontier; LaBrava, set in Miami, orchestrates a complex scheme involving a long-forgotten film noir actress and an ex-Secret Service man turned photographer; Glitz plunges into the seedy world of Atlantic City casinos and into the twisted mind of the unforgettable Teddy Magyk, one of Leonard’s most indelible bad guys; and Freaky Deaky sets in motion a tumultuous ’60s flashback, laced with harsh and outlandish comic touches, as a pair of morally dubious veterans of Ann Arbor revolutionary politics try out some new scams.
