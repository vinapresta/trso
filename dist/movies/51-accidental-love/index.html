It was an unforgettable scene. Dina Matos McGreevey, an attractive woman in her mid-thirties, wife, mother, and First Lady of the state of New Jersey, watched silently as her husband, then New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, resigned his office with the revelation that he was a &quot;gay American.&quot; The picture of grace and loyalty, perfectly composed in her pale blue suit, Dina Matos McGreevey gave no sign of the tangled mixture of fear, sorrow, and anger she felt that day, no hint of the devastation that was to come. Since then she has been asked repeatedly about the nature of her marriage, about what she knew and when she knew it. Since then, she has remained silent. Until now. Speaking up at last, Dina Matos McGreevey here recounts the details of her marriage to Jim McGreevey. What emerges is a tale of love and betrayal, of heartbreak and scandal . . . and ultimately, hope. It all began with so much promise. Dina Matos was a responsible and civic-minded young woman who fell in love with the passion of political action. When Jim McGreevey walked into her life, he appeared to be a kind and loving man, someone with whom she could build a life based on shared ideals, a strong spiritual commitment, and a desire to make a difference in the world. Beyond their initial chemistry, Dina Matos was attracted by Jim McGreevey&#39;s principles and his unwavering devotion to his work. She didnt know that his life, and thus their marriage, were built on a foundation of lies; that his past was littered with casual sexual encounters in seedy bookstores and public parks; or that, by his own admission, he began an adulterous affair with another man while she was in the hospital awaiting the birth of their child. &quot;Could I have known,&quot; she asks &quot;How could I have known&quot; With scalding honesty, she tells of her life with the former governor, of the politics and public service that brought them together, and the lies that tore them apart.

Hypochondriac. Lover of Japanese Fighting Fish (and of Charlie Lawton, her Washington Post reporter boyfriend). Jumper-to-conclusions. And when all these identities collide -- as they do most days -- the results are always unpredictable. Sammy&#39;s role as an advisor to Vice President Robert Gary (RG for short) has led her down some exciting professional paths, like when she accompanies RG on a trip to India to help open pharmaceutical supply lines, and some troubling ones -- like when the president secretly asks her to plumb those lines to acquire as yet unapproved drugs for his own personal use. Her job interferes with her love life, too, after Charlie is transferred to New York for a huge story just when she&#39;s expecting a proposal, and they find that distance combines poorly with Sammy&#39;s dedication to her work and her overactive imagination. And then there&#39;s the surprising -- though ego-pleasing -- series of passes thrown Sammy&#39;s way, culminating in a highly embarrassing photo of a Hollywood hotshot&#39;s hand where it doesnt belong, published in the pages of Us Weekly . . . As the dual crises in Sammy&#39;s personal and professional lives come to a head, and her ideals are put to the ultimate test, readers will be flipping pages madly, wondering what might come next. Because in Sammy&#39;s house, anything is possible.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb1950"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=W4trAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Sweet Jiminy" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Sweet Jiminy</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Kristin Gore<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Hachette UK</span><span><span> - </span>4/19/2011</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>In the throes of a quarter-life crisis, Jiminy Davis abruptly quits law school and flees Chicago for her grandmother Willa&#39;s farm in rural Mississippi.
