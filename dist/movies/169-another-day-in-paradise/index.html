Little writes about the world he used to inhabit, a place filled with drugs, crime and danger at every turn. His electrifying prose brings to life the rough, raw, and seedy life of Boston&#39;s underworld where corruption lies at the heart of every deception. Bobbie is a young criminal prodigy. Living in Boston he&#39;s approached by a mysterious Greek on behalf of an anonymous shipping tycoon, who wants to commission a theft. The Fogg museum is the target; a collection of ancient Greek coins the score. Everything goes fine with the burglary, but with easy street just around the corner Bobbie&#39;s life takes an unexpected twist and his big score evaporates. With his life on the line, Bobbie must learn who he can trust when trusting anyone can make you lose everything. Steel Toes is as close to reality as fiction can get. Little draws you in with his knife sharp writing, his authentic and unflinching characters and plot as tight and strong as the hold of addiction.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2448"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=FUQr9KRm89kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Tom Brown Saves the World" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Tom Brown Saves the World</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Eddie Beverage<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Booksurge Publishing</span><span><span> - </span>3/15/2005</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>More than anything in the world, Tom Brown wants to be a rock star. Raised on a Kentucky farm with the only satellite dish in town, Tom grew up worshipping the heroes of film, television and especially music, endlessly fantasizing about rock n roll glory and the material spoils of fame and fortune. Now he lives in Colorado with his wife, Trisha Mae Bailey, and spends most of his time snowboarding and jamming with his mediocre cover band, The Spindles. Toms marriage is no honeymoon. In fact, its headed for divorce. Trisha feels sorry for her husband. She believes Toms a victim; a lamb to the slaughter for MTV and the New Advertising Age who sold him a vision of his future then stunted his emotional development with toys and beer. Meanwhile, the Supreme Ruler of Mars is hatching a plan to teach the people of Earth a long-overdue lesson and chooses Tom as the perfect vehicle for his universal message: Think for yourselves! Back on Earth, Tom escapes to the snow-covered slopes (as he often does) with his best friend, computer hacker and slacker guru, Dave Madsen. During a treacherous descent, Tom and Dave are caught in a devastating avalanche and Tom is knocked unconscious. When he comes around in a mountainside cave, hes greeted by Jo-Jo and The Fat Man, two men in black (and paisley) who quote a copy of Earthlings for Messiahs and claim to have been sent to accompany Tom on his mission. Tom quickly learns that the men in black and paisley are not his friends but actually assassins hired by FORC.O.R., a conglomeration of big businesses that will stop at nothing from preventing Tom from delivering his message.Guided through a strange super-consumer alternate reality by a hologram image of Dave who may or may not be dead and a narcissistic China-man named Yi Chong, Tom finds himself on a blind date with destiny at the Whiskey bar in Hollywood, California. On the first night of a nationwide tour, a queer punk band called Penis Envy loses their lead guitarist and plucks Tom out of the crowd to take his place. Even though bringing down the house with a bunch of guys in dresses wasnt exactly Toms vision for super-stardom, before he can say boy band, hes sharing a cramped van, shooting a low budget video and rocking every drag bar in sight! Before long, Toms a mega-star, stalked by the tabloids and a legion of obsessive fans armed with a slew of mis-information about the new celebrity. Even members of Toms inner circle clamber for a piece of the action, but do they have him all wrong? Yi wants to break into American action films and needs a courageous white partner, but is Tom really his man?? The bands manager, super fly Sassafras Worthington, wants to harness Toms power as a gay icon. But Toms not even gay! Toms fame is all smoke and mirrors and its not long before he begins questioning everything he thought he knew about fame. He wont find his destiny in the form of a multi-million dollar recording contract, but in making the ultimate sacrifice. The venue for Toms defiance: the final gig of the bands tour on Free Thought Day in New York City. But will they make it in time as the fate of the world hangs in the balance?? Not if the men in black and paisley and their tommy guns have anything to say about it!!</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2449"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=P_g7BAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book THE YEAR THAT CHANGED MY LIFE" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>THE YEAR THAT CHANGED MY LIFE</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Eddie M.

As you look outside you would see hundreds of hardworking business, technical, marketing people passing by. You probably are one of those productive and relatively happy carbon based human units out there. Have you ever thought of what if you get attacked by a life threatening disease like cancer suddenly and without warning? Do you know that half of all living Americans will get some form of cancer at some point in their lives? Eddie Leung, the author, was an engineering physicist that was having fun in all sorts of exciting projects, good at what he was doing and relatively healthy and happy. Within a period of a month, he was hit with the life threatening acute pancreatitis and then pronounced having a rare &amp; extremely aggressive form of cancer called the Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). This is the story of his journey through a rigorous treatment that involves the dangerous Whipple surgery, high dosage radiation &amp; chemo therapies and subsequently unpleasant blood infection (sepsis), applying his scientific approach and management skills. This book is a collection of what Eddie learned in terms of the skills as to how to fight cancer physiologically, mentally and spiritually; how to recover from a major surgery like Whipple and make the dreadful radiation and chemo therapies work for the patient. The detailed manuscript describes the feelings and thinking of a cancer patient, the trials and tribulations a caretaker must go through, the importance of faith &amp; positive mental attitude in his battle for survival and eventually the jubilation associated with the change from a cancer patient to a cancer survivor. It is filled with fear, tears, compassion, light-hearted moments and finally happiness. Since cancer is becoming so common in our daily life, it is a must read for the general public, especially cancer patients and their caretakers.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2450"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=g3TJ_-Tw3q0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Three Days in the Hermit Kingdom" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Three Days in the Hermit Kingdom</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Eddie Burdick<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by McFarland</span><span><span> - </span>1/10/2014</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>To most of the world, North Korea remains a secretive and mysterious nation, one that has tightly controlled the outflow of information in order to groom its public image. This book chronicles a rare, regime-sanctioned excursion by a North American into the heart of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. What is revealed is often what’s expected, such as the adoration of leaders, excursions to national monuments, and exposure to propaganda relating to self-sufficiency. But as a Korean speaker, the author gathered a lot more information than the scripted English narration provided by his Korean guides. Behind the propaganda of the Communist regime, the authentic, eye-opening North Korea is revealed.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2MDNmYWEtNGMzNC00YjdlLTkxYTItNTk3Njk1YTBiNzk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Another Day in Paradise" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Another Day in Paradise is based on the book Another Day in Paradise? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Bobbie is an addict and small-time thief.
