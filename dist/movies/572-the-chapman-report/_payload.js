Before they can finalize their manuscript, however, a cryptic letter from a German dentist sends Sir Harrison off to attempt the excavation of the site of the Führerbunker, where Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, lived out the final weeks of their life before committing suicide and being cremated in a shallow pit. The thing is – maybe they didn't. Unfortunately, before the excavation can begin, Ashcroft is run down in a hit-and-run that would seem accidental – except the driver backed up and ran him over a second time. Armed only with the dentist's letter, her notes, and the determination to finish her father's book, Emily Ashcroft makes her own journey to Berlin. She is joined by a Russian museum curator, an American architect writing a book on Nazi and Third Reich architecture, and a Mossad agent, posing as a reporter. Together they uncover what may be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated – the faked death of the Father of the Third Reich, and the plan to bring the Nazi party back to power. Through harrowing adventures, steamy romance, impersonators, SS guards, and survivors they piece together the missing puzzle pieces of what really happened so long ago. The only question is – are they up to the challenge, and, as they begin to close in, can they survive it?",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ha56BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1986-01-01",publisher:"Crossroad Press",subtitle:b}},{id:4095,attributes:{title:"The Almighty",description:"Edward Armstead's obsession with surpassing the power of his late father leads him into a ruthless quest for omnipotence and a manipulation of world events through terrorism",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iqNOnFrNEw8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1983-12-01",publisher:"Dell Publishing Company",subtitle:b}},{id:4096,attributes:{title:f,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:["R. & G.
