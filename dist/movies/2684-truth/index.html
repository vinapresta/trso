She had the bedrock of respect of her peers -- in 2003 alone, she broke the story of the Abu Ghraib prison tortures (which won CBS The Peabody Award) and the existence of Strom Thurmond&#39;s illegitimate bi-racial daughter Essie Mae Washington. But it was Dan Rather&#39;s lightning rod of a story on George W. Bush&#39;s National Guard Service that brought Mapes into an unwanted limelight. The firestorm that followed the broadcast led not only to Mapes&#39; firing and Rather&#39;s stepping down from his anchor chair a year early, but to an unprecedented &quot;internal&quot; inquiry into the story -- chaired by former Reagan Attorney General Richard Thornburgh. Peopled with an historic and colorful cast of characters—from Karl Rove to Summer Redstone to John Kerry to Col. Bobby Hodges -- this groundbreaking book about how the television news is made (and unmade) made headlines itself when first published. But this, it turns out, is only part of the story. Mapes talks for the first time about the riveting behind-the-scenes action at CBS during this frenzied period and exposes some of the largest political and social controversies that have broken in this new age of dissonance.

A riveting play-by-play of a reporter getting and defending a story that recalls All the President&#39;s Men, Truth puts readers in the center of the &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; story on George W. Bush&#39;s shirking of his National Guard duty. The firestorm that followed that broadcast--a conflagration that was carefully sparked by the right and fanned by bloggers--trashed Mapes&#39; well-respected twenty-five year producing career, caused newsman Dan Rather to resign from his anchor chair early and led to an unprecedented &quot;internal inquiry&quot; into the story...chaired by former Reagan attorney general Richard Thornburgh. Truth examines Bush&#39;s political roots as governor of Texas, delves into what is known about his National Guard duty-or lack of service-and sheds light on the solidity of the documents that backed up the National Guard story, even including images of the actual documents in an appendix to the book. It is peopled with a colorful cast of characters-from Karl Rove to Sumner Redstone-and moves from small-town Texas to Black Rock-CBS corporate headquarters-in New York City. Truth connects the dots between a corporation under fire from the federal government and the decision about what kinds of stories a news network may cover. It draws a line from reporting in the trenches to the gutting of the great American tradition of a independent media and asks whether it&#39;s possible to break important stories on a powerful sitting president.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12842"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=aCCpCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Truth" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Truth</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Mary Mapes<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by St. Martin&#39;s Griffin</span><span><span> - </span>10/13/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Mary Mapes&#39;s Truth (previously published as Truth &amp; Duty) was made into the 2015 film Truth, starring Cate Blanchett, Robert Redford, Topher Grace and Elizabeth Moss.
