Years ago, Owen Daybright was an orphan on a railroad crew when old Arch Stobie took him under his wing at the Acorn ranch. He needed the quiet, hardworking Owen for a special job: to act as a friend and be a calming influence on his fiery-tempered son, Lee. But, instead, the boys showed an immediate hatred for each other that never waned. Only out of loyalty to Arch did Owen cover for Lee’s stupidity and carelessness. But now Lee’s crossed the line. There are some angry men after him for disgracing their sister. And he’s put a target on Owen’s back. Unless Owen is very fast and very careful, he’s going to end up taking a bullet for the brother he’d like to kill himself. Luke Short, a winner of the Levi Strauss Golden Saddleman Award from the Western Writers of America, blazed the trail for authors such as Louis L’Amour and Elmore Leonard. Vengeance Valley is one of his most compelling tales of western adventure.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GAkXDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[g],firstBook:true,published:"2016-11-01",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:a}},{id:11077,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Luke SHORT (pseud.)"],firstBook:e,published:"1951-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:11078,attributes:{title:"Vengeance Valley.
