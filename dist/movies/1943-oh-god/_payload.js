Mild-mannered Jerry Landers is a hard working Assistant Manager at a Food World supermarket outlet. He's always trying to do his best at his job. But his generally uneventful life takes a turn when he receives a hand delivered note in the mail to attend an interview with God. Believing it a gag from his friend Artie Coogan, Jerry decides to go to the interview based on circumstances which compel him to do so. Based on further circumstances of the interview, Jerry, despite not being a religious person, ultimately does believe that who he meets with, initially only a voice, is indeed God, who eventually does show himself in a physical form to Jerry. God wants Jerry to be his messenger, much like a present day Moses, to pass along to the human race that \"he\" has provided all the necessary components of a successful existence, and it is up to the human race to do with those components as they believe fit to reach that success. God came at this time because of his disappointment with the current state of the world. He also chose Jerry as his messenger because of Jerry being a decent person. Jerry tries to convey the message as best as he can, but runs into one roadblock after another. Once Jerry does gain a wider audience, he is treated as a crazy person and\u002For a fanatic, those opinions which affect his and his family's life. Jerry believes he has no other option but to continue to do this job for God despite these negative effects. It may take him getting a meeting with so-called experts, theologians, before he is taken seriously, or not, as some of those, such as Reverend Willie Williams, God knows is using religion for their own as opposed to societal benefit.",slug:"oh-god"}}},books:{data:[{id:9763,attributes:{title:b,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:e}},{id:9764,attributes:{title:b,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:f,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:e}},{id:9765,attributes:{title:b,description:g,thumbnail:g,authors:[a],firstBook:f,published:"1978-01-01",publisher:g,subtitle:g}},{id:9766,attributes:{title:"The Boyfriend from Hell",description:"Veronica Delaney didn’t intend to fall for another bad guy, especially not one who just might be evil incarnate . . .

Go to 600 Madison Ave., room 3700, Monday, at 11 a.m.” When a struggling writer receives this typed note in the mail one morning, curiosity wins out and he finds himself keeping this mysterious appointment. Soon he’s in an ordinary conference room with an intercom on the floor, furiously scribbling shorthand notes as he interviews God, a deity who badly wants to improve His public profile. Sometimes God speaks through the intercom, other times He communicates as a hot dog vendor on the corner. But however God appears, He’s giving this anointed journalist the story of a lifetime—and all he has to do is sell the story to the public. Adapted as the classic film starring George Burns, Oh, God! is a warm and witty satire about life, the Lord, the media, and the need for some good publicity.
