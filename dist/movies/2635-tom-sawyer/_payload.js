Together with his friend Huckleberry Finn, the son of a drunk, ruthless father, he accidentally witnesses a murder. What unfolds in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) is a series of exhilarating events: both friends identify Injun Joe, the real murderer, in court; testify to the innocence of the person wrongly accused and find buried treasure in a haunted house. In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Huck escapes from the clutches of his father and encounters Jim, a runaway slave. They embark on an exciting journey along the Mississippi River, meeting different people and participating in their unusual lives. With time, Huck finds himself in a moral dilemma over societal values and his own friendship with Jim. With The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain presents a sharp social commentary on 19th-century American life through scathing satire, folksy humour, colloquial speech and coarse language.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=PVFnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2018-07-05",publisher:"Om Books International",subtitle:b}},{id:12613,attributes:{title:"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn",description:"In a realm on the brink of war, will an unsuspected heir to the kingdom of Coronnan and to magic long-banished from the land offer the only hope for survival? Glenndon--son of witchwoman Brevelan and Jaylor, Senior Magician and Chancellor of the University of Magicians--has never spoken aloud. He has no need because his telepathic talent is strong and everyone associated with the University can \"hear\" him. He can throw master-level spells, but because he will not speak, Jaylor has refused to promote him from apprentice to journeyman magician. Still, everyone knows it is only a matter of time until Glenndon will take his rightful place at the University. Then an urgent missive arrives from King Darville. The Council of Provinces is near rebellion over the king's lack of a male heir. Rather than see his fourteen-year-old daughter, Rosselinda, married off just to procure an heir, he orders his illegitimate son Glenndon to Coronnan City to become his successor. And suddenly Glenndon's world is in chaos. The man he's always known as his father is not. Instead he is the son of the king. But in this city where court politics can prove deadly and where magic is forbidden, the young man must hide his talents even as he struggles to find his voice and his destiny. And one slip could see Glenndon, Darville, Rosselinda, and even Jaylor doomed, for the lords and the people fear magic more than potential invasion, legendary monsters, and civil war.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2UlLLgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,"Shelley Fisher Fishkin"],firstBook:c,published:"2013-07-02",publisher:"Signet Classic",subtitle:b}},{id:12614,attributes:{title:d,description:"The adventures of a mischievous young boy and his friends growing up in a Mississippi River town in the nineteenth century.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=5Psd5zv_oVcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a,"Robert Blaisdell","John Green"],firstBook:c,published:"1997-01-01",publisher:"Courier Corporation",subtitle:b}},{id:12615,attributes:{title:e,description:"Tom Sawyer is a mischievous young boy with an undying hunger for adventure, and a knack for getting into trouble. He lives with his Aunt Polly in the Mississippi River town of St Petersburg, Missouri. He plays hooky from school; hangs around with Huck Finn, the unsophisticated son of the village drunkard; and deceives his friends into trading their treasures with him. Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new arrival in town, who returns his affection initially, and even agrees to an 'engagement'. However, after a slip of the tongue from Tom, she walks off in a huff. From innocent and imaginary adventures, Tom's life suddenly takes a new turn. One night, while Tom and Huck Finn are in a graveyard, they witness an incident they should not have. Terrified, they flee from the spot, and swear a blood oath that they will never reveal their secret to anyone. Tom and Huck then find themselves entangled in a series of real and exciting adventures, with dangerous men constantly at their heels. Can the boys stand up to the occasion, and become real-life heroes? Will they ever be able to reclaim their normal, carefree lives again?",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lKaKRaO1c3IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2010-10-05",publisher:"Campfire",subtitle:"A Novel"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940905372}}("Mark Twain","",null,"Tom Sawyer","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"))
