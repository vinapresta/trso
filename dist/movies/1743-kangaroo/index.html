A few years after the close of World War I, English author Richard Lovat Somers and his German wife, Harriet, have fled the grim remains of Europe and ventured to Australia. But they soon discover the new world is an escape from neither the demands of politics nor the nightmarish memories of Richard’s service on the front lines. In Sydney, Richard meets Benjamin Cooley, a charismatic lawyer known to all as Kangaroo. But Kangaroo is also the leader of an underground fascist organization. While Richard finds himself drawn to the man’s strength and certainty of purpose, he is simultaneously repelled by his embrace of dehumanizing violence. In this semi-autobiographical novel, author D. H. Lawrence plumbs the depths of his own experience in the Great War while exploring in vivid detail the breathtaking landscape and social volatility of Australia.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb8947"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=RK3oDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Kangaroo (Historical Novel)" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Kangaroo (Historical Novel)</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->D.

H. Lawrence, first published in 1923. It is set in Australia.Summary : Kangaroo is an account of a visit to New South Wales by an English writer named Richard Lovat Somers and his German wife Harriet in the early 1920s. This appears to be semi-autobiographical, based on a three-month visit to Australia by Lawrence and his wife Frieda, in 1922. The novel includes a chapter (&quot;Nightmare&quot;) describing the Somers&#39; experiences in wartime St Ives, Cornwall, vivid descriptions of the Australian landscape, and Richard Somers&#39; sceptical reflections on fringe politics in Sydney. Kangaroo&#39;s movement, and the &quot;great general emotion&quot; of Kangaroo himself, do not appeal to Somers, and in this the novel begins to reflect Lawrence&#39;s own experiences during World War I. Somers also rejects the socialism of Struthers, which emphasises &quot;generalised love&quot;.Australian journalist Robert Darroch - in several articles in the late 1970s, and a 1981 book entitled D.H. Lawrence in Australia - claimed that Lawrence based Kangaroo on real people and events he witnessed in Australia. The extent to which this is true remains a matter of controversy - particularly by Joseph Davis in his 1989 D. H. Lawrence at Thirroul. Davis is sympathetic to the view that &quot;Kangaroo&quot; may be based on real events but argues that it is impossible that Lawrence had time to meet clandestine political leaders in Sydney when he was too busy writing his novel in Thirroul. Davis feels it is more likely to have been a local south-coast identity associated with Thirroul who would have provided some of the details of Lawrence&#39;s political plot.Biography : D. H. Lawrence (1885 - 1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter. His collected works represent, among other things, an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. Some of the issues Lawrence explores are sexuality, emotional health, vitality, spontaneity, and instinct.Lawrence&#39;s opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his &quot;savage pilgrimage&quot;. At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as &quot;The greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.&quot; Later, Cambridge critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness, placing much of Lawrence&#39;s fiction within the canonical &quot;great tradition&quot; of the English novel.The 4th child of Arthur John Lawrence, a barely literate miner at Brinsley Colliery, and Lydia (n�e Beardsall), a former pupil teacher who, owing to her family&#39;s financial difficulties, had to do manual work in a lace factory...Extrait : Kangaroo is an account of a visit to New South Wales by an English writer named Richard Lovat Somers, and his German wife Harriet, in the early 1920s.
