Whether discussing Bing Crosby, Bruno Schulz or Shakespeare, he manages to prioritise style and substance simultaneously, his tone never less than pitch-perfect, his argument always considered. With each phrase carefully crafted and each piece offering cause for thought, the resulting volume – which takes the reader from London to Bali, theatre to library, from pre-election campaigning to sitting in front of the TV at home, watching The Sopranos and The West Wing – is remarkable not only for its range and insight, but also its intimacy and honesty. A contemporary everyman, James is also unmistakably himself, and The Meaning of Recognition shows him at his witty, learned – and heartfelt – best.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=XK9_-XsnCYEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Clive James"],firstBook:c,published:"2012-12-13",publisher:"Pan Macmillan",subtitle:"New Essays 2001-2005"}},{id:3632,attributes:{title:b,description:d,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=MSIEAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:f,publisher:g,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940933515}}("","By Love Possessed",null,"A highly-respected, middle-aged lawyer's involvements with love are revealed in a series of flashbacks","James Gould Cozzens","1957-01-01","New York : Harcourt, Brace"))
