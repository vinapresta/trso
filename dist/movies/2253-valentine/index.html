What she uncovers makes her the target of a shocking conspiracy. Nora Baron’s life is perfect. She lives on Long Island Sound, teaches acting at a local university, and has a loving family. Then one phone call changes everything. She’s informed that her husband, Jeff, has died in a car crash while on a business trip in England. Nora flies to London to identify the body, which the police have listed as a “John Doe.” When she leaves the morgue, a man tries to steal her purse containing Jeff’s personal effects. Clearly, all is not as it seems. At her hotel, Nora receives a cryptic message that leaves her with more questions than answers. She follows the message’s instructions to France, where a fatal encounter transforms her into a fugitive. Wanted for murder, on the run in a shadowy landscape of lies, secrets, and sudden violence, Mrs. “John Doe” must play the role of a lifetime to stay one step ahead of a ruthless enemy with deadly plans for her—and for the world. Praise for Mrs. John Doe “This is a rare spy thriller, smart, beautifully written, and stay-up-all-night enjoyable!”—Gayle Lynds, New York Times bestselling author of The Assassins “It isn’t easy to blindside a fellow suspense author, but Tom Savage manages to fool me every time. A clever, compelling, and cinematic page-turner in which nothing is as it seems, Mrs. John Doe opens with a twist I didn’t see coming and closes with a satisfying bang. This longtime Savage fan ranks Mrs. John Doe right up there with Precipice.”—Wendy Corsi Staub, New York Times bestselling author of The Black Widow “Mrs. John Doe races a fictional path somewhere between Alfred Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, a modern heroine-on-the-run spy thriller dealing with some of our time’s deadliest challenges.”—James Grady, New York Times bestselling author of Last Days of the Condor “Savage twists the plot in two startling ways, and Nora’s transformation from wealthy home-focused wife to clever investigator holds up brilliantly. . . . I enjoyed each page, gasped at the swift twists, and came away with a hunger for more of the same, whether it be thrills, France, or books by Tom Savage.”—Kingdom Books</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11025"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=-XkDuAEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Valentine" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Valentine</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Tom Savage<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Little Brown &amp; Company</span><span><span> - </span>1/1/1996</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Suspense novelist Jillian Talbot finds her idyllic and fashionable life in Greenwich Village shattered by the pervasive attentions of a stalker, who grows more deadly as Valentine&#39;s Day approaches. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11026"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=e5VzAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book A Penny for the Hangman" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>A Penny for the Hangman</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Tom Savage<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Alibi</span><span><span> - </span>10/7/2014</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>USA TODAY BESTSELLER • In Tom Savage’s chilling novel of suspense, an ambitious reporter is beckoned to an island paradise for the story of a lifetime. But this scoop might just be the death of her. Fifty years ago, on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas, two teenagers born to privilege were convicted of slaughtering their parents in cold blood. Today the men are free and a Hollywood movie has been made about the murders. For Karen Tyler, an eager New York journalist, the case is irresistible. She has been invited to the Virgin Islands for an interview that’s too good to pass up . . . and sounds too good to be true. Karen packs her bikini and her digital recorder and follows an ingeniously designed trail that leads her to a wealthy, mysterious figure. The man claims to be one of the notorious boys, but Karen soon learns that all is not as it seems. On this isolated utopia of sun and surf, a young reporter far from home fights for the truth—and for her life. Because the shocking secret behind the infamous atrocities has remained hidden all these years. And the killing isn’t over yet. Praise for A Penny for the Hangman “Tom Savage spins a web of suspense into this tale of far-off climes, interweaving letters, newspaper accounts, and diary fragments for a pulled-from-the-headlines feel. In Cold Blood meets ‘The Most Dangerous Game,’ A Penny for the Hangman is a predator-and-prey chase that takes the reader to a tropical paradise, and reveals the steaming underbelly it hides.”—Jenny Milchman, award-winning author of Cover of Snow Praise for Tom Savage “Savage knows the mystery novel inside and out, and it shows on every page.”—James Patterson “Tom Savage is becoming a master of the high-speed thriller.”—Michael Connelly “Tom Savage is a very gifted writer who creates living, breathing characters, wonderful dialogue, and mesmerizing tension.”—Nelson DeMille “Savage writes with fierce energy, piercing holes in the shredding fabric of our society, where no one is safe, no one is free from harm.”—Lorenzo Carcaterra</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11027"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=J1NXDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Devil and the Deep Blue Spy" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Devil and the Deep Blue Spy</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Tom Savage<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Alibi</span><span><span> - </span>4/9/2019</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Nora Baron returns!

A fifth girl, plump and insecure, agrees, but they end up making out under the bleachers. When a group of school bullies catches them, the girl claims that Jeremy attacked her. This causes them to strip off his clothes and beat him up in front of the entire school. Flash forward to 2001. We meet the five girls who were in that school gym: Kate, Paige, Shelly, Lily and the formerly plump Dorothy. They are all in their 20&#39;s now and trying to sort out their love lives, which is appropriate, since Valentine&#39;s Day is coming up. After a disastrous date with a loser, one of the girls, a pre-med student, is murdered by a Cherub-mask wearing killer who sent her a death threat in the form of a Valentine card prior to the attack. After the four remaining girls are reunited at her funeral, they all start receiving threatening cards and messages. At first they don&#39;t know who would want to hurt them, but eventually they figure that maybe Jeremy is responsible. Police records show that Jeremy has completely disappeared, so no one knows what he looks like. Could the formerly nerdish Jeremy have had plastic surgery and turned into one of the girls&#39; handsome boyfriends? Who ever it is, the lone survivor has to put a stop to this spurned individual&#39;s murder spree before she, too, becomes a valentine to die for.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">4.9/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">12%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">18/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Valentine, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
