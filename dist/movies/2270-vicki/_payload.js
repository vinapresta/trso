That’s how Martin Thorpe ended up there, a fourteen-year-old boy with a habit of getting thrown out of boarding schools. Too smart for his own good, Thorpe is currently obsessed with the trial of Tommy Smith—a young man who has just been sentenced to hang for murdering his father. Thorpe has been dating Tommy’s sister, was at the house the night of the murder, and may know something that could save Tommy’s life. The detective investigating the case has questions for Thorpe. Why were Tommy and his father fighting that night? What did Thorpe hear the old man say before he was killed? And why does Thorpe have such a blood-stained permanent record?
