That’s the Sunday she helps a passing stranger pick up the papers he’s dropped from his briefcase. From then on Clare’s problems got bigger and more dangerous. Someone puts a hole in her arm with a silenced gun in a crowded street. Is it the same someone who put the bomb in her apartment? The cop assigned to her case is Lieutenant Malchek, an ex-Vietnam sniper who now specialises in hit-men and contract killers. Maybe the man who dropped the papers was someone special.

Laura Brandon, recently arrived physiotherapist and self-appointed sleuth, realises that a lot of people have something to hide. Confronted by tight-lipped colleagues, inter-staff feuds, and strange tales about a shadowy evil that lurks in the woods, Laura begins to believe the theory of a psychotic killer on the loose. Then another, eerily similar, murder occurs and she knows the solution cannot be impersonal. Fast-paced, entertaining and expertly plotted, Paul Gosling’s latest tale from the Great Lakes brilliantly confirms her mastery in the art of the murder mystery.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=BY05DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:i,publisher:f,subtitle:b}},{id:5995,attributes:{title:"Backlash",description:"A person who would kill a cop respects no-one. A person who would kill a cop would kill anyone. Four cops, from four precincts, all shot dead. A chaotic wave is erupting through the American police force in Paula Gosling’s second Jack Stryker novel, Backlash. When a federal investigator appears on the killer’s hit list, the simple answers seem to be disappearing way too fast and time is running out. Are these homicides linked? Or is the killer choosing victims at random? Can the police department computer make any connections that stick? Detective Lieutenant Jack Stryker is on the case with his partner Agent Dana Marchant, and together they must track a marksman with an uncanny criminal brain and a ruthlessly persistent purpose.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=sJlJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:j,publisher:f,subtitle:b}},{id:5996,attributes:{title:"Death Penalties",description:"After her husband’s tragic death Tess Leland has finally started to piece her life back together – but someone is determined to take it apart again . . .
