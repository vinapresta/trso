Once that is grasped that enigma of sleep and dreaming largely explains itself, and dreaming can be seen for what it is - a biological safeguard of the sleeping person. So begins Bill Naughton's exploration of the dreaming mind. For many years, Bill Naughton, perhaps best known as the author of Alfie, kept a journal about his and others dream world. At times deeply personal and at others more general, this account covers a number of key topics, from the scientific and symbolic, to sexuality, arousal and guilt. Also brought into play are dream stimuli, and the importance of the artistic, be it literature, film, theatre, opera or the plastic arts. This deeply meditated book on dreaming is sure to provoke, stimulate - and to contribute to our overall understanding of just How and Why We Dream.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=5avuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2009-01-01",publisher:"Arcadia Books Limited",subtitle:d}},{id:468,attributes:{title:"The Goalkeeper's Revenge",description:"The Goalkeeper's Revenge is comprised of stories of a Lancashire childhood: of football on the streets, fishing, fighting and school, of growing up and looking for work, and of characters such as Spit Nolan the champion trolley-rider, Sim Dalt the goalkeeper and Maggie Gregory the amazing reader.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=G-g3g3GBL0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:d}},{id:469,attributes:{title:"On the Pig's Back",description:"From the renowned author of Alfie comes an autobiography that provides both a fascinating memoir of a bygone era -- the North of England before World War II -- and a moving account of the struggles of a self-taught man to find his voice as a writer. At age 30, Bill Naughton was a married man with two children, driving a coal truck in Bolton for a living. Getting up around midnight to write, he found that the effort of shaping a single sentence brought him out in a thicker sweat than did the loading of a few tons of coal. But eventually, after years of strain and torment, he had by 1945 published and broadcast a number of stories, and his first book, A Roof Over Your Head, was in its third printing. The events leading up to this transformation make a lively narrative, spiced with hints on writing which no aspirant should miss. A visit to his birthplace in County Mayo in 1945 results in a description rich in forgotten folklore and custom of the Irish people, and in turn leads to the story of his family's emigration. At the age of 4, Naughton was loathe to leave his Irish home but was finally persuaded by his mother, who told him that once in England they would all be on the pig's back (or high on the hog). Bolton during the Great War and the Depression is then vividly evoked in a series of portraits: domestic life in a coalmining family; the author's career at Catholic elementary school; the raucous street scene of the day; and the degradations of life on the dole. With a wonderful ear for dialogue and the rhythms of local speech, Bill Naughton gives the reader a unique look at the triumphs and tragedies of pre-war working class life.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=sS9bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:"Oxford University Press, USA",subtitle:"An Autobiographical Excursion"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568348953}}("Bill Naughton","movie",null,"","series",1,"Alfie","2011-09-28","A&C Black"))
