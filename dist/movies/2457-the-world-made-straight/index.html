Although George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child, Serena is new to the mountains—but she soon shows herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattle-snakes, even saving her husband&#39;s life in the wilderness. Together this lord and lady of the woodlands ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Yet when Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons&#39; intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel as the story moves toward its shocking reckoning. Rash&#39;s masterful balance of violence and beauty yields a riveting novel that, at its core, tells of love both honored and betrayed.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11879"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=k2nsDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Time Zones" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Time Zones</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Ron Rash<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Wildside Press LLC</span><span><span> - </span>6/20/2020</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Barb Goffman—one of the most celebrated authors and editors in the mystery field—is selecting modern classic mystery stories for a new imprint at Black Cat Mystery, &quot;Barb Goffman Presents.&quot; This volume features &quot;Time Zones,&quot; by Ron Rash.
