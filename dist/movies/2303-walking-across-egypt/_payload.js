When Clyde Edgerton was four years old, his mother took him to the local airport to see the planes. For the boy, it was love at first sight. Eighteen years later, she would take him to the same airport to catch a flight to Texas for Air Force pilot training. Edgerton tells the story of his lifelong love affair with flying, from his childlike wonder to his job as a fighter pilot flying reconnaissance over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Now, decades after the Vietnam War, he looks back at his youthful passion for flying, at the joy he took in mastering it, at the exhilaration—and lingering anguish—of combat aviation. It is a story that will resonate with every pilot who remembers their first takeoff, first landing, and first solo flight, or any passenger who has marveled at a journey through the sky—Solo offers a “heartfelt celebration of the flying life” (The New York Times). “Spellbinding, exciting, funny, informative, moving, and beautifully, beautifully, beautifully written.” —Tim O’Brien",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CFjp0Ed_E6YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:f,published:"2006-11-10",publisher:e,subtitle:"My Adventures in the Air"}},{id:11211,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Clyde Eddgerton"],firstBook:f,published:"2003-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:11212,attributes:{title:"Lunch at the Piccadilly",description:"In his eighth deliciously funny novel, Clyde Edgerton introduces us to the irrepressible Lil Olive, who's recently arrived at the Rosehaven Convalescence Center to recuperate from a bad fall. Lil longs to be back in her own apartment, and since her driver's license doesn't expire until her ninety-seventh birthday, she also longs to get back behind the wheel of her sporty '89 Olds. To pass the time until independence, Lil strikes up some new friendships. Mrs. Maudie Lowe and Mrs. Beatrice Satterwhite, who are laying bets on whether Clara Cochran's glass eye comes out at night. And L. Ray Flowers, the freelance evangelical preacher with fancy white hair who sings his sermons, strums a mean guitar, and aspires to an even higher calling. Keeping a watchful eye on them all is Carl, Lil's middle-aged bachelor nephew with a heart of gold and the patience of a saint. But soon Rosehaven is turned upside down and the outcome is anyone's guess. Lil and the girls steal a car and hit the highway. L. Ray's vision of a national movement to unite churches and nursing homes (Nurches of America) is embraced by the residents. And then there's Darla Avery's dirty little secret, which could spell the end for the visionary preacher. Edgerton looks at the challenges of aging with sympathy, sensitivity, and his trademark sense of humor. Like the bestseller Walking Across Egypt, this is vintage Edgerton: wise, wistful, and laugh-out-loud funny.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=LddUkObEcOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:f,published:"2003-10-01",publisher:e,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703487757}}("","movie","Walking Across Egypt","Clyde Edgerton","Algonquin Books",null,"series",1,"\"An unpretentious, finely-crafted novel that will linger with the readers like the last strains of a favorite hymn.
