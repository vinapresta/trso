(San Francisco Chronicle). On the night of March 1, 1932, celebrated aviator Charles Lindbergh’s infant son was kidnapped from his New Jersey home. The family paid $50,000 to get “Little Lindy” back, but his remains were discovered in a grove of trees four miles from the Lindbergh house. More than two years after the abduction, Bruno Hauptmann, an unemployed carpenter and illegal German immigrant, was caught with $20,000 of the ransom money. He was arrested, tried, and executed for the crime. But did he really do it? New York Times–bestselling author Noel Behn spent eight years investigating the case, revisiting old evidence, discovering new information, and shining a bright light on the controversial actions of public figures such as New Jersey Governor Harold Hoffman, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, New Jersey State Police Superintendent H. Norman Schwarzkopf, and Charles Lindbergh himself. The result is a fascinating and convincing new theory of the crime that exonerates Hauptmann and names a killer far closer to the Lindbergh family. A finalist for the Edgar Award, Lindbergh “not only provides answers to the riddles of the ‘Crime of the Century,’ but hurls us into time past, to a special moment in American history” (Peter Maas, New York Times–bestselling author of Underboss).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=c2A0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:"2017-09-26",publisher:e,subtitle:"The Crime"}},{id:1246,attributes:{title:"The Shadowboxer",description:"A rogue spy weaves a deadly web of intrigue in this pulse-pounding World War II espionage thriller from the bestselling author of The Kremlin Letter. A man with many names moves through the shadows of war-torn Europe. Known to most as “the Shadowboxer,” he is a spy and an assassin, the scourge of the Nazi high command. Courageous and highly skilled, he sneaks in and out of the most heavily guarded concentration camps, liberating select prisoners. To those he sets free, the motives behind the Shadowboxer’s actions hardly matter. But leaders of the Third Reich and Soviet Intelligence officials are desperate to determine what game the lone wolf agent is playing, and what his missions mean for the fate of postwar Germany. In the high-stakes realm of international espionage, information is the most valuable prize of all, and no secrets are bigger than those kept by this mysterious operative. But when he discovers his role in a massive conspiracy that could cost the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers, the Shadowboxer has no choice but to step into the light. A powerful tale based in the grim realities of covert operations, The Shadowboxer brims with suspense and nonstop action. Intricately plotted and disturbingly authentic, it cements Noel Behn’s reputation as one of the twentieth century’s most original and convincing spy novelists.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=J7gPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:e,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568447866}}("","Noel Behn","movie","The Kremlin Letter","Open Road Media",null,"2016-06-14","series",1,"New York Times Bestseller: Six American spies embark on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines in this classic Cold War espionage thriller. Lt. Cmdr. Charles Rone, a young naval intelligence officer with a sterling record, finds himself abruptly discharged from the service. Without his consent, Rone has been recruited to join a top-secret network of agents who operate independently of the US government. Led by a cynical spymaster known only as the Highwayman, the group will break any law and destroy as many innocent lives as necessary to stop the spread of communism. In Moscow, the Americans must make contact with a high-level mole in the Kremlin and recover a letter that could spark a nuclear war if it falls into the wrong hands. But treachery is an integral part of this shadow conflict between superpowers, and no sooner has the team arrived in the Soviet capital than the double-crossing begins. One devastating betrayal follows the next as Rone desperately tries to stay alive and out of the clutches of the KGB long enough to find out who compromised the mission. Inspired by author Noel Behn’s service in the US Army’s Counterintelligence Corps, The Kremlin Letter is a realistic and hard-edged tale of international intrigue that ranks with the best of John Le Carré and Len Deighton. A New York Times bestseller, it was the basis for a John Huston film starring Orson Welles and Max von Sydow.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_7YPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
