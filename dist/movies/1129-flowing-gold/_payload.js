In the process he meets and befriends an oil rig foreman, Hap O'Connor, that friendship on Hap's side because of Johnny coming to his aid, and despite Hap knowing about the police looking for him for the murder rap. In a later situation, Hap reunites with an old friend, Wildcat Chalmers, who is looking for men to help dig a new well, which is made all the more difficult in his arch enemy, Charles Hammond, doing whatever he can to prevent him from striking oil. In working for Hammond, Johnny is also reunited with Hap and changes his allegiances when he learns that Hammond's actions are meant to hurt Wildcat and by association his friend Hap, with who he also joins forces. Johnny and Hap's friendship is threatened when a love triangle forms, the third being Wildcat's daughter, Linda Chalmers, who grew up around the oil fields and knows her away around the men who work on such. While Hap has always been in love with Linda without really expressing it, Johnny also falls for her but doesn't act on it in knowing Hap's feelings for her. What happens with this triangle and Hap and Johnny's friendship is affected by Johnny's past and the goings on with the well, including if they strike oil.",slug:"flowing-gold"}}},books:{data:[{id:6384,attributes:{title:c,description:"Room service at the Ajax is of a quality befitting the newest, the largest, and the most expensive hotel in Dallas. While the standard of excellence is uniformly high, nevertheless some extra care usually attaches to a breakfast ordered from the Governor's suite-most elegant and most expensive of all the suites-hence the waiter checked over his card and made a final, fluttering examination to be sure that the chilled fruit was chilled and that the hot plates were hot before he rapped on the door. A voice, loud and cheery, bade him enter. Would the gentleman wish his breakfast served in the parlor or -No, the gentleman would have it right in his bedroom; but first, where were his cigarettes? He hoped above all things that the waiter had not forgotten his cigarettes. Some people began their days with cold showers-nothing less than a cruel shock to a languid nervous system. An atrocious practice, the speaker called it-a relic of barbarism-a fetish of ignorance. Much preferable was a hygienic, stimulating cigarette which served the same purpose and left no deleterious aftereffects.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=6nbtBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[f],firstBook:true,published:"2007-02-01",publisher:"1st World Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:6385,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Rex Ellingwood Beach"],firstBook:e,published:"2012-03-31",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:6386,attributes:{title:c,description:"This Is A New Release Of The Original 1922 Edition.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KZ-6oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Rex E.
