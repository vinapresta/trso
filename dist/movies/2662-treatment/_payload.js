Praised as \"a true comic artist\" (Janet Malcolm), Daniel Menaker turns the patient-analyst relationship on its ear in this \"witty, incisive novel\" (Chicago Tribune). Jake Singer, a young New York City schoolteacher, has a lot going for him -- and even more holding him back. Plagued by anxiety over his conflicts with his father, his stalled career at a prestigious prep school, and his current single status, he lands on the couch of Dr. Ernesto Morales, the Cuban-Catholic-Freudian analyst from hell. Morales's slash-and-burn sessions are worthy of the Spanish Inquisition; his sarcastic remarks and fractured phrases prod at Jake even as he makes his way into the upscale world of wealthy Manhattanite Allegra Marshall. And slowly, Jake begins to come to terms with life, love, and other irrationalities. Like it or not, the Treatment may just be crazy enough to work -- and may bring Jake face to face with what he most wants to avoid: his own humanity.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pwFT69oK_aAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1999-04-01",publisher:"Washington Square Press",subtitle:a}},{id:12736,attributes:{title:g,description:"A wry, witty, often tender memoir by a former New Yorker and Random House editor who has great tales of a life in words.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=n6tXnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2014-11-04",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12737,attributes:{title:"Terminalia",description:"In January, Daniel Menaker-former New Yorker fiction editor, Random House editor-in-chief, and author of The Treatment, among many other books-received a terminal diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and the twenty-four poems collected in TERMINALIA were written over the course of Menaker's diagnosis and treatment.

A GOOD TALK is an analysis of and guide to that most exclusively human of all activities-- conversation. Drawing on over forty years of experience in American letters, Menaker pinpoints the factors that drive and enliven every good conversation: the vagaries (and joys) of subtext; the deeper structure and meaning of conversational flow; the subliminal signals that guide our disclosures and confessions; and the countless other hurdles we must clear along the way. Moving beyond self-help musings and \"how to\" advice, he has created a stylish, funny, and surprising book: a celebration of \"the most excusively human of all activities.\" In a time when conversation remains deeply important-- for building relationships, for relaxing, even for figuring out who we are-- and also increasingly imperiled (with Blackberries and texting increasingly in vogue), A GOOD TALK is a refreshing celebration of the subtle adventures of a good conversation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HWA3AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2010-01-04",publisher:"Hachette UK",subtitle:"The Story and Skill of Conversation"}},{id:12739,attributes:{title:g,description:"The author of The Treatment traces his literary life as a longtime editor at The New Yorker and Random House, detailing his early days as a fact checker and the people that influenced his career as well as the losses and family life that shaped his achievements as a writer. 30,000 first printing.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=5TXQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2013-01-01",publisher:"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568335113}}("","Daniel Menaker","movie",null,"series",1,"My Mistake"))
