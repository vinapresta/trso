An Italian-English author, he was called the “Alexander Dumas of modern fiction.” Sabatini was born in Italy but spent much of his youth in England and other European countries. He first achieved fame as a journalist before becoming one of the greatest adventure novelists in the history of world literature. It took Sabatini almost 20 years after publishing his first novel to gain notoriety. Success finally arrived in 1921 with the publication of Scaramouche, a novel about the French Revolution. Soon the author’s pen shifted to tales of the sea – scribbling adventures of free corsairs. Sabatini’s full talent revealed itself in books like The Sea Hawk and The Black Swan. His legendary series featuring Captain Blood became popular the world over. Today, his books are still treasured by readers and have served as the inspiration for dozens of films.
