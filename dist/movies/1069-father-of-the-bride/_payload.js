Poor Mr. Banks! His jacket is too tight, he can’t get a cocktail, and he’s footing the bill...He’s the father of the bride. Stanley Banks is just your ordinary suburban dad. He’s the kind of guy who believes that weddings are simple affairs in which two people get married. But when daddy’s little girl announces her engagement to Buckley, Mr. Banks feels like his life has been turned upside down. The dress that will be worn for one day is how much? Why would anyone spend that much for flowers? And however befuddled Mr. Banks becomes, no one pays the least amount of attention to him. He must host cocktail parties with the in-laws to be, initiate financial planning talks with Buckley, and moderate family conferences on who will be invited to the reception. But poor Mr. Banks! All he sees are the bills, and no one talks to him about losing his little girl! Father of the Bride is a timeless, heartwarming, and hysterically funny tale that appeals directly to the lighter side of life, and any man with a child about to get married can appreciate Mr. Banks’s situation and the troubles that befall him.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SVF1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2015-04-28","Simon and Schuster"))
