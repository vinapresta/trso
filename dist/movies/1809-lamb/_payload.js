Set on the Colorado high plains, the town of Lions is nearly deserted. Built to be a glorious city, it was never fit for farming, mining, trading, or any of the industries its pioneers imagined. The Walkers have been settled on its barren terrain for generations—a simple family in a town still enthralled by promises of bigger, better, and brighter. But when a stranger appears, his unsettling presence sets off a chain reaction that will change the fates of everyone he encounters. When the patriarch John Walker dies, his son Gordon must choose between leaving for college with his girlfriend, Leigh, or staying with his family to look after their failing welding shop—and carry on a mysterious family legacy. While Leigh is desperate to make a better life in the world beyond Lions, Gordon is strangely hesitant to leave it behind. And as more families abandon the town, it seems that listening to reason must come at the cost of betraying his own heart. “Nadzam weaves a strange and mesmerizing story” that explores ambition and an American obsession with self-improvement, the responsibilities we have to ourselves and each other, as well as the everyday illusions that pass for a life worth living (Publishers Weekly).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:"2016-07-05",publisher:"Open Road + Grove\u002FAtlantic",subtitle:f}},{id:9205,attributes:{title:"Love in the Anthropocene",description:"“Dale Jamieson and Bonnie Nadzam cause us to think—and to feel—what life will be like in a future where nothing is left that is spontaneous, accidental, or uncontrolled. A beautiful—and frightening—book.” —Naomi Oreskes, professor, history of science, Harvard; author, Merchants of Doubt “Nadzam's prose is just gorgeous—she writes about people and skies and mountains and landscapes with incredible precision and appreciation of beauty. A reader can swim in these sentences and soak up the landscape via the prose with great pleasure.” —Aimee Bender on Bonnie Nadzam's Lamb “I started reading [Jamieson's prose] and couldn't stop... Part of what’s mesmerizing about climate change is its vastness across both space and time. Jamieson, by elucidating our past failures and casting doubt on whether we’ll ever do any better, situates it within a humanely scaled context.” —Jonathan Franzen on Dale Jamieson's Reason in a Dark Time An audacious collaboration between an award-winning novelist and a leading environmental philosopher, Love in the Anthropocene taps into one of the hottest topics of the day, literally and figuratively—our corrupted environment—to deliver five related stories (“Flyfishing,” “Carbon,” “Holiday,” “Shanghai,” and “Zoo”) that investigate a future bereft of natural environments, introduced with a discussion on the Anthropocene—the Age of Humanity—and concluding with an essay on love. The “love” these writer\u002Fphilosophers investigate and celebrate is as much a constant as is human despoliation of the planet; it is what defines us, and it is what may save us. Science fiction, literary fiction, philosophical meditation, manifesto? All the above. This unique work is destined to become an essential companion—a primer, really—to life in the 21st century.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=R990CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Dale Jamieson",a],firstBook:e,published:"2014-09-15",publisher:"OR Books",subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568445161}}("Bonnie Nadzam","movie","Lamb","",null,"A Novel","series",1,"Winner of the 2011 Flaherty-Dunnan First Novel Prize Lamb traces the self-discovery of David Lamb, a narcissistic middle aged man with a tendency toward dishonesty, in the weeks following the disintegration of his marriage and the death of his father. Hoping to regain some faith in his own goodness, he turns his attention to Tommie, an awkward and unpopular eleven-year-old girl. Lamb is convinced that he can help her avoid a destiny of apathy and emptiness, and even comes to believe that his devotion to Tommie is in her best interest. But when Lamb decides to abduct a willing Tommie for a road trip from Chicago to the Rockies, planning to initiate her into the beauty of the mountain wilderness, they are both shaken in ways neither of them expects. Lamb is a masterful exploration of the dynamics of love and dependency that challenges the boundaries between adolescence and adulthood, confronts preconceived notions about conventional morality, and exposes mankind’s eroded relationship with nature.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kmfReOyHLWkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-09-13","Other Press, LLC"))
