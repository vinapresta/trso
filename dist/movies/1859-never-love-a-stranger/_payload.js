But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive. As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption -- each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future -- will help steer his rocky course. Gritty, compelling, and groundbreaking for its time, A Stone for Danny Fisher is a tale of ambition, hope, and violence set in a distinct and dangerous period of American history. A classic, sexy bestseller by Harold Robbins, reintroduced to a whole new generation of readers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Dv8G_TqENicC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2007-08-07",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531331355}}("","movie","Harold Robbins","series","Never Love a Stranger",null,1,"Harold Robbins' very first novel is also one of his most powerful. Never Love a Stranger tells the gritty and passionate tale of Francis \"Frankie\" Kane, from his meager beginnings as an orphan in New York's Hell's Kitchen. From that confused and belittling start, Frank works his way up, choosing the wrong side of the law to make a name for himself. At a young age, he becomes one of the city's most dangerous men, indulging in his passion for power, sex, and the best things in life-whether or not they can be purchased. First published in 1948, the novel began Robbins' prolific career after someone made him a $100 bet that he couldn't write a bestseller. Twenty-six pot-boiling novels later, he proved the power of his words. Never Love a Stranger takes an unflinching look at a New York that's long gone by-exposing life during and after the Great Depression, when the syndicate ruled the city without mercy.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KpoPqfb4M18C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2010-06-25","AuthorHouse"))
