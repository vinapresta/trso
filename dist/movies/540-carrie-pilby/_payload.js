List 10 things you love (and do them!) 2. Join a club (and talk to people!) 3. Go on a date (with someone you actually like!) 4. Tell someone you care (your therapist doesn’t count!) 5. Celebrate New Year’s (with other people!) Seriously? Carrie would rather stay in bed than deal with the immoral, sex-obsessed hypocrites who seem to overrun her hometown, New York City. She’s sick of trying to be like everybody else. She isn’t! But when her own therapist gives her a five-point plan to change her social-outcast status, Carrie takes a hard look at herself—and agrees to try. Suddenly the world doesn’t seem so bad.

She thought she'd be picking out strollers and booties for the children she and her husband were planning to have. Instead, she's mourning his loss and coming to terms with being a widow at twenty-nine.It's been over a year now, and her friends have convinced her it's time to get back into the swing of things (even though looking for love is the last thing she wants to do). Although they've developed many a dating rule between them, now that Gert's a part of their single-girl crew, she's beginning to realize they don't know the first thing about men. Of course, Gert doesn't know the first thing about dating, since she married her college sweetheart, so maybe joining forces will work out after all. But does Gert have it in her to fight her way through the leather-jacketed and miniskirted crowds in search of a second miracle?It's back to square one on everything. Well, actually she's done it all before. Square two, then.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=flDtofgI-9YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2012-06-15"))
