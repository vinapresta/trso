The ominous tone of this exquisite collection is established at its onset, as a bereaved father stalks the man who murdered his son. Three stories later, a college student suffers a violent death at the hands of her boyfriend. And in later episodes, relationships falter and fail, not all fatalities being of the flesh. Featuring some of the Dubus canon’s most haunting narratives, Finding a Girl in America is a remarkable lesson in the depiction of the darker side of human nature.

While this is an impressive publishing record for any writer, for Dubus, who suffered a near-fatal accident mid-career, it is near miraculous. Just after midnight on July 23, 1986, after stopping to assist two stranded motorists, Dubus was struck by a car. His right leg was crushed and his left leg had to be amputated above the knee. After months of hospital stays and surgeries, he would suffer chronic pain for the rest of his life. However, when he gave his first interview after the accident, his deepest fear was that he would never write again. This collection of interviews traces his career beginning in 1967 with the publication of his novel The Lieutenant, to his final interview given right before his death February 24, 1999. In between are conversations that focus on his shift to essay writing during his long recovery period as well as those that celebrate his return to fiction with the publication of &quot;The Colonel&#39;s Wife,&quot; in 1993. Dubus would share as well stories surrounding his Louisiana childhood, his three marriages, the writers who influenced him, and his deep Catholic faith.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb1153"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=x29ZSJ2FmlMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Times Are Never So Bad" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Times Are Never So Bad</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Andre Dubus<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Open Road Media</span><span><span> - </span>11/23/2010</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>A classic collection that contains some of the author’s “most compelling and suspenseful” work—including ‘The Pretty Girl’ and ‘A Father’s Story’ (Joyce Carol Oates, The New York Times Book Review). In his fourth collection, Andre Dubus revisits his central themes of infidelity and fallibility, exploring the minds of his characters with unflinching honesty and unfailing compassion. Set in the New England landscape, and populated by the complex, damaged individuals he has come to claim as his own, these stories are ultimately characterized by their extraordinary ordinariness. They are a reverent testament to the passion and sadness of humble lives. Deeply moving and insightful, The Times Are Never So Bad is yet another masterful work by a writer whose Chekhovian sensibilities inform—yet never distract from—his own fully realized perspective.

Andre Dubus is celebrated for depicting the subtlest of human emotions and finding compassion for the most damaged, and damaging, of characters. In the essays collected here, the author turns the microscope on himself, and the results are no less illuminating. Intimate and evocative, these autobiographical accounts of his childhood in Louisiana, his experiences in the Marine Corps, and, later, his life as a husband and father, paint a vivid portrait of this acclaimed author. Written with the sapience and depth of feeling that made his reputation in fiction, Broken Vessels is perhaps Dubus’s most intimate work of all.
