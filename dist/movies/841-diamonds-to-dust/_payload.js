She possessed an IQ of 163, played violin and piano at a concert level, had a degree in Science, spoke 5 languages fluently, and yet became a celebrity by portraying a 'dumb blond.' By the age of 23 she became the most publicized Hollywood star in the world, but her success was short lived. Five children, three ex-husbands, countless love affairs, and addictions to diet pills and booze took its toll on Mansfield, and in 1967 a grisly car accident ended her life. This film features many of Jayne Mansfield's personal items, and focuses on the turbulent final years of the troubled star's career.",slug:"diamonds-to-dust"}}},books:{data:[{id:5192,attributes:{title:a,description:"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=14KrMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Frank Ferruccio"],firstBook:true,published:"2007-01-01",publisher:"Outskirts Press",subtitle:"The Life and Death of Jayne Mansfield"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940956117}}("Diamonds to Dust"))
