She possessed an IQ of 163, played violin and piano at a concert level, had a degree in Science, spoke 5 languages fluently, and yet became a celebrity by portraying a 'dumb blond.' By the age of 23 she became the most publicized Hollywood star in the world, but her success was short lived. Five children, three ex-husbands, countless love affairs, and addictions to diet pills and booze took its toll on Mansfield, and in 1967 a grisly car accident ended her life.
