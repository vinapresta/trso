This antiquarian book is highly recommended for those with an interest in fifteenth century England, and will greatly appeal to fans and collectors of Stevenson’s seminal work. Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was an influential Scottish writer who is most famous for writing \"Treasure Island\" and \"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\".
