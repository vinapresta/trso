On Valentine's Day, four members of the Coverdale family--George, Jacqueline, Melinda and Giles--were murdered in the space of 15 minutes. Their housekeeper, Eunice Parchman, shot them, one by one, in the blue light of a televised performance of Don Giovanni. When Detective Chief Superintendent William Vetch arrests Miss Parchman two weeks later, he discovers a second tragedy: the key to the Valentine's Day massacre hidden within a private humiliation Eunice Parchman has guarded all her life. A brilliant rendering of character, motive, and the heady discovery of truth, A Judgement in Stone is among Ruth Rendell's finest psychological thrillers.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=K2Y7TCK_IJQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2009-09-23",publisher:"Vintage Crime\u002FBlack Lizard",subtitle:a}},{id:8827,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1977-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:8828,attributes:{title:"The Secret House of Death ; Shake Hands Forever ; A Judgment in Stone",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1991-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:8829,attributes:{title:"Ruth Rendell Omnibus",description:"A judgement in stone: When a housekeeper carries out a modern \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" on the family that employs her, Detective Chief Superintendent William Vetch investigates to uncover evidence of a personal tragedy that precipitated the crime.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vpjlAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1993-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940962748}}("","Ruth Rendell",null,"A Judgement in Stone"))
