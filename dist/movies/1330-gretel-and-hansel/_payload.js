Once upon a time was a poor lumberjack who had two children, Hansel and Gretel. Unfortunately, he was no longer able to provide for his family and his second wife, who hated the children, said they had to abandon them. After two unsuccessful attempts, the parents finally managed to get rid of the children, who had to survive on their own. They looked for help and found a strange house, very interesting but also very dangerous... The collection \"Once Upon a Time\" offers a new and richly illustrated version of the most famous fairytales. EXCERPT Once upon a time, a brother and a sister called Hansel and Gretel lived in a tiny cottage in the forest with their father, who was a poor woodcutter, and their stepmother. Their stepmother was very unkind and said they didn’t have enough food for the children. One day, she told her husband that he must take Hansel and Gretel deep into the forest and leave them there. “They are old enough now to take care of themselves!” said the mean stepmother. The woodcutter who dearly loved his children was very sad. However, he had no other choice but to follow the wish of his cruel wife.

Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. Kay Nielsen (1886-1957) was a Danish illustrator of the golden age of illustration. He was influenced by Japanese art and the Swedish fairy tale illustrator John Bauer and contributed to the Art Nouveau movement. His illustrations are bold, and vibrant - often reproduced by a 4-colour process which set him apart from his contemporaries who typically used a 3-colour process. His art is characterised by long, swooping lines, open spaces and a certain macabre quality and his ephemeral illustrations are intricately inventive, flirting with implausibility. The shift in taste from fantasy to realism after WWII meant that Nielsen did not retain his pre-war popularity. However, interest in his exquisite illustrations has since been revived, and they now command a high price in today's art world.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=63T4ugAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Brothers Grimm",e,"Wilhelm K.
