The book offers a unique balance of theory and clear-cut choices for customizing every phase of a qualitative study. A scholarly mix of classic and contemporary studies from multiple disciplines provides compelling, field-based examples of the full range of qualitative approaches. Readers learn about adaptive ways of designing studies, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting findings. Key aspects of the researcher's craft are addressed, such as fieldwork options, the five phases of data analysis (with and without using computer-based software), and how to incorporate the researcher's “declarative” and “reflective” selves into a final report. Ideal for graduate-level courses, the text includes:* Discussions of ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, feminist research, and other approaches.* Instructions for creating a study bank to get a new study started.* End-of-chapter exercises and a semester-long, field-based project.* Quick study boxes, research vignettes, sample studies, and a glossary.* Previews for sections within chapters, and chapter recaps.* Discussion of the place of qualitative research among other social science methods, including mixed methods research.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lyCGBeo8sI8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Robert K.

Fox invites the reader into a life so full-from his mother dressing him up in women's clothing to his father coercing him into medical school; his search for belonging in the \"families\" of academia, publishing, beatniks and hipsters, Latin America, transsexuals, Judaism, and his own progeny; and the seemingly-glamorous whirlwind world of the arts and culture-that it leaves little else to be desired. Originally from Chicago, Fox studied culture intensely and traveled widely becoming thoroughly Latinized by early adulthood. Much of Fox's life was shaped by his international interests-from his publishing and academic careers to his personal tastes and selection in women-which factored largely into his career successes and personal adventures. Never one to be content with the average or mundane, Fox keeps the pace moving with one exciting revelation or humorously self-interested remark after another. The picture of self-awareness-and -actualization?-Fox's question of Who, Me? has not so much to do with the author\u002Fpoet\u002Fscholar he's become as it does with how he evolved into this multifaceted character of his own creation.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=tUWPZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Hugh Fox"],firstBook:c,published:"2011-06-12",publisher:"Sunbury Press, Incorporated",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:12349,attributes:{title:"Maybe It's You",description:"How can a girl who’s been rejected by Once Upon A Time ever believe that happily-ever-after even exists?

When Abortion Was a Crime is the must-read book on abortion history. Originally published ahead of the thirtieth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, this award-winning study was the first to examine the entire period during which abortion was illegal in the United States, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and ending with that monumental case in 1973. When Abortion Was a Crime is filled with intimate stories and nuanced analysis, demonstrating how abortion was criminalized and policed--and how millions of women sought abortions regardless of the law. With this edition, Leslie J. Reagan provides a new preface that addresses the dangerous and ongoing threats to abortion access across the country, and the precarity of our current moment. While abortions have typically been portrayed as grim \"back alley\" operations, this deeply researched history confirms that many abortion providers--including physicians--practiced openly and safely, despite prohibitions by the state and the American Medical Association. Women could find cooperative and reliable practitioners; but prosecution, public humiliation, loss of privacy, and inferior medical care were a constant threat. Reagan's analysis of previously untapped sources, including inquest records and trial transcripts, shows the fragility of patient rights and raises provocative questions about the relationship between medicine and law. With the right to abortion increasingly under attack, this book remains the definitive history of abortion in the United States, offering vital lessons for every American concerned with health care, civil liberties, and personal and sexual freedom.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xOFSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Leslie J.
