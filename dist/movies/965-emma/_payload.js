The wealthy, and somewhat spoilt Emma Woodhouse has no interest in falling in love or getting married, but finds pleasure in trying to make romantic matches for her friends. After the successful union of Miss Taylor, her long time governess and friend, with Mr Weston, she takes young Harriet Smith under her wing, the next target of her matchmaking schemes. Mr Knightley, a trusted friend of the Wood houses, is the only one who criticizes her and advises whenever necessary, but the naïve Emma has a long way to go before she realises the consequences of her actions as a self-proclaimed matchmaker. The story follows Emma’s journey through all her meddling and how she discovers a lot about herself and about an unrealised love!",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=aPDDDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:"Om Books International",subtitle:c}},{id:5713,attributes:{title:a,description:"Jane Austen’s Emma (1816) tells the story of the coming of age of Emma Woodhouse, “handsome, clever, and rich,” who “had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.” Typical for the novel’s time, Emma’s transition to womanhood is accomplished through courtship—both of those around her and, ultimately, her own. As in other Austen works, education and courtship go hand in hand, and Emma’s process of learning to relinquish the power of having her own way is also a process of falling in love. However, in Emma this classic plot is both complicated by and reflective of a collection of contemporary issues, assumptions, and anxieties that highlight just how “political” even the most conventional of courtship plots can be. This Broadview edition includes a critical introduction and an extensive collection of historical documents relating to the composition and reception of the novel, the social implications of England’s shift from a rural agrarian to an urban industrial economy, the role of women in provincial society, and the contemporary preoccupation with health and the treatment of illness.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-b9HczoD4u4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2004-05-07",publisher:"Broadview Press",subtitle:c}},{id:5714,attributes:{title:a,description:"Depicts a rich and beautiful heiress whose matchmaking schemes cause many complications",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-zTuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"1991-01-01",publisher:"Everyman's Library",subtitle:c}},{id:5715,attributes:{title:a,description:"Publisher Description",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QOOO-DdXvB0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2005-10-20",publisher:"Cambridge University Press",subtitle:c}},{id:5716,attributes:{title:a,description:"Emma Woodhouse imagines that she dominates those around her in the small town of Highbury, but her inept matchmaking creates problems for herself and others.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ui8KN7WuxycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:e,published:"2003-01-01",publisher:"Collector's Library",subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703550729}}("Emma","Jane Austen","","movie",null,"series",1,"N\u002FA"))
