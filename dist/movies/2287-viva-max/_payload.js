The election is eight days away. Republican nominees James Meredith, a fundamentalist Christian whose ambitions border on white supremacy, is pitted against four reporters who have just discovered damaging information that could ruin his career. What unfolds during The Last Debate will change the course of electoral politics and the news business forever…. As \"the ultimate insider-outsider\" (Washington Post), and as a moderator of presidential debates past and present, journalist and PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer knows the world he writes about only too well. His novel—a satirical and absorbing story of the behind-the-scenes world of news journalism—also exposes the duplicitous posing and posturing of made-for-TV political events. And with the 2000 elections looming ahead, the targets of his satire—religious fundamentalists, self-important journalists, feral network programming heads—could not be more timely.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lC9Mngb22u0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2000-09-21",publisher:"PublicAffairs",subtitle:c}},{id:11185,attributes:{title:h,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[a,e],firstBook:d,published:k,publisher:l,subtitle:c}},{id:11186,attributes:{title:"The Franklin Affair",description:"BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Jim Lehrer's Tension City. “Three may keep a secret if two of ’em are dead.” –Poor Richard’s Almanack[pg. 27 of mss] R Taylor arrives in Philadelphia for the funeral of his longtime friend Dr. Wally Rush with a heavy heart. Not only has the world lost one of its preeminent, Pulitzer Prize—winning American Revolution historians, but R has lost his mentor, the man who led him to devote his life’s work to the study of “The First American,” Benjamin Franklin. The bond between them was sealed when R did Wally a favor that could never be revealed. But Wally saved one final secret for R, disclosed in a letter conveyed by the will’s executor. Written in the slow, painful script of the professor’s last days, the note delivers an incredible bombshell. Wally, it seems, had stumbled upon twelve handwritten pages in a code commonly used by spies during the revolutionary war. The pages refer to George Washington, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, and level a shocking charge–that Benjamin Franklin committed a heinous crime. Wally, not wanting to foul the image of his lifelong hero, had kept this monumental secret until his death. But as R races to unravel the mystery, he faces an onslaught of obstacles. Vicious blackmail, a threat of sabotage against his own career, and grave personal doubts threaten to overtake R as he struggles with a discovery that has the potential to completely alter the fabric of American history. Rich with revelations, rife with the darkest depths of deceit and mystery, and enlightened by the unparalleled insights of America’s first patriots, The Franklin Affair is a tense, constantly surprising novel about the ultimate quest for truth and justice.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dXFh8PLdqKUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2005-04-26",publisher:"Random House",subtitle:"A Novel"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703490394}}("Jim Lehrer","movie","",null,"James Lehrer","series",1,"Mack to the Rescue","When a medical situation forces him out of the political race against a governor looking to privatize state government, Mack ends up supporting an unlikely candidate who ends up in a questionable situation of his own that throws his whole campaign into turmoil.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=PQ1GONZBJ_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2008-01-01","University of Oklahoma Press"))
