On a winterâs day, Chris Gardner set off with his nine-year-old granddaughter Brooke to find the harmonica of her dreams. The search sends them North âbeyond the wallâ into a foreboding Chicago neighborhood and, soon, on a harrowing adventure that will change both of their livesâand ours. Chris is still mourning the loss of his girlfriend to brain cancer. Her question haunts him: âNow that we know how short life can be, what will you do with the time you have left?â After five years, he feels an urgencyâwhat he calls, âAtomic Timeâ in which every second countsâto find an answer, but is stuck. Even while giving Brooke permission to aspire to one day become President of the United States, he knows itâs time to reclaim his own permission to dream. Lost, Chris and his granddaughter board a bus, reminding him of earlier rides through dark times when dreams of a better life kept him alive. As the two wind through a changing cityscape, Chris reflects on past lessons that offer powerful guidance for dreaming your way to monumental success. At its heart, this book lays out a blueprint for building a dream-come-true lifeâeven during uncertainty. Gardner delivers the secrets to achieving a prosperous careerâfrom a method for identifying your ultimate dream to a playbook for becoming world class at it. His tools include the ânew 3 Râsââor the Rep, the Rap and the Rolodexâwhich reveal how to earn a stellar reputation, develop a rap for marketing yourself, and amass a Rolodex of rewarding relationships. No matter how much wealth you achieve, Chris notes, true success comes from enriching the lives of othersâso all can still have access to the American Dream. Toward the end, Brooke observes that in Atomic Time itâs never too late for anyone to reinvent themselves and change their fortune. Chris, hearing her, realizes what his next pursuit will beâto go back to high school and give permission to dream to the next generation of problem solvers and change makers. A true fable, Permission to Dream is a timeless and timely manifesto for turning dreams into actionâbeginning right now.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb10754"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=xUVtpmQZlZUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Pursuit of Happyness" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Pursuit of Happyness</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Chris Gardner<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Harper Collins</span><span><span> - </span>3/17/2009</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>The astounding yet true rags-to-riches saga of a homeless father who raised and cared for his son on the mean streets of San Francisco and went on to become a crown prince of Wall Street At the age of twenty, Milwaukee native Chris Gardner, just out of the Navy, arrived in San Francisco to pursue a promising career in medicine.
