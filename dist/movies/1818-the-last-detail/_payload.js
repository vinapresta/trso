Meadows is not much of a thief. Indeed, in his late teens, he is not much of a man at all. His great crime was to try to steal forty dollars from the admiral's wife's pet charity. For this, he's been sentenced to eight years behind bars. At first, Buddusky and Mulhall view the journey as a paid vacation, but their holiday spirits are quickly depressed by the prisoner, who looks prepared to break into tears at any moment. And he has the lowest self-image imaginable. Buddusky gets it into his head to give Meadows a good time and teach him a bit about getting on in the world. Lesson one: Don't take every card life deals you. Next, he teaches Meadows to drink, and, as a coup de grace, finds a nice young whore to instruct him in lovemaking. Mule, who worries aloud about his own position with military authority, seems pleased with Meadows's progress.

In this novel, Ponicsan writes about his pocket of Lantenengo County as he remembers it from his boyhood. He asks his mother to fill in the gaps in his memory and to comment on how things have changed over the years. She volunteers much more information and her letters are reproduced throughout the book. They provide still another focus of the novel itself. Ponicsan chronicles with precise economy the converging lives of the weird but lovable residents of Andoshen: the odd relationship between Shakey the Cop and Thunder Przwalski, town ne'er-do-well; the trouble between Ella Bistricky of Ella’s Lunch and her brother-in-law, R.K., who took five years to get over Rita Hayworth; the love affair between Estelle Wowak. a wrapper-leaf stripper at the cigar factory, and the Reader; the exploits of Duncan, who once gave Willie Mosconi a good game; of Kayo Mackey, who was the only boy ever to hurt Gene Tunney; of Eggshell Oechsle, a primitive existentialist; of Stump Bonomo, Champion of the Tri-County Finger League; of Doc Rice, reluctant dentist; of Jake the Fake, Gyp the Blood, Lemonears Behind the Brewery, and the rest of the boys at Brolly's Bar and the Majestic Pocket Billiards. Andoshen, Pa. is the touching story of a tough, often violent, coal town entirely undermined and sinking more rapidly than the jewel of the Adriatic. The poverty of Andoshen is as rich as that of Tortilla Flat or Cannery Row. It is a new and unique addition to the literary map of the world. DARRYL PONICSAN brings to this novel the same curious, compassionate irony that made his other books, The Last Detail and Goldengrove, so highly acclaimed.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jHeoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[m],firstBook:d,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:"Speaking Volumes",subtitle:e}},{id:9241,attributes:{title:c,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[k],firstBook:d,published:f,publisher:l,subtitle:g}},{id:9242,attributes:{title:"Last Flag Flying",description:"Now a major movie starring Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne, directed by Richard Linklater! Darryl Ponicsan's debut novel The Last Detail was named one of the best of the year and widely acclaimed, catapulting him to fame when it was first published. The story of two career sailors assigned to escort a young seaman from Norfolk to the naval prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire—and of the mayhem that ensues—was made into an award-winning movie starring Jack Nicholson. Last Flag Flying, set thirty-four years after the events of The Last Detail, brings together the same beloved characters—Billy Bad-Ass Buddusky, Mule Mulhall, and Meadows—to reprise the same journey but under very different circumstances. Now middle-aged, Meadows seeks out his former captors in their civilian lives to help him bury his son, a Marine killed in Iraq, in Arlington National Cemetery. When he learns that the authorities have told him a lie about the circumstances of his son's death, he decides, with the help of the two others, to transport him home to Portsmouth. And so begins the journey, centered around a solemn mission but, as in the first book, a protest against injustice and celebration of life too, at once irreverent, funny, profane, and deeply moving. Last Flag Flying is now a major movie from Amazon Studios, directed by Richard Linklater and starring Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, and Laurence Fishburne.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jjaCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Ponicsán, Darryl"],firstBook:d,published:f,publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:g}},{id:9243,attributes:{title:c,description:"Unlike other branches of the armed services, the navy draws its police force from the ranks, as temporary duty. The risk is that men on Shore Patrol might bring their humanity to the task. This accounts for the underlying tension in \"The Last Detail,\" which takes place during the height of the Vietnam War. Billy Bad-Ass and Mule Mulhall, two career sailors in transit in Norfolk, awaiting permanent orders, are given a detail: \"chaser\" duty. Their assignment is to escort and deliver Larry Meadows, an 18-year-old sailor, from Norfolk to Portsmouth, N. H., where he is to serve an eight year sentence in the brig. It's good duty, on the face of it, until the two old salts realize the injustice of the sentence and are oddly affected by the true innocence of their prisoner, even though he is guilty as charged. Failure, or refusal, to carry out their duty is never a question, no matter how much they may hate the detail or how wrong it seems, and yet something must be done, some gesture made in order to help their hapless prisoner survive the long ordeal he faces, and to purge their sense of shame. \"The Last Detail\" was Darryl Ponicsan's first book and it catapulted him into the front rank of American novelists. It was made into the 1973 film starring Jack Nicholson, and has become a classic of the Golden Age of American cinema.
