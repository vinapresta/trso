In this novel, Ponicsan writes about his pocket of Lantenengo County as he remembers it from his boyhood. He asks his mother to fill in the gaps in his memory and to comment on how things have changed over the years. She volunteers much more information and her letters are reproduced throughout the book. They provide still another focus of the novel itself. Ponicsan chronicles with precise economy the converging lives of the weird but lovable residents of Andoshen: the odd relationship between Shakey the Cop and Thunder Przwalski, town ne&#39;er-do-well; the trouble between Ella Bistricky of Ella’s Lunch and her brother-in-law, R.K., who took five years to get over Rita Hayworth; the love affair between Estelle Wowak. a wrapper-leaf stripper at the cigar factory, and the Reader; the exploits of Duncan, who once gave Willie Mosconi a good game; of Kayo Mackey, who was the only boy ever to hurt Gene Tunney; of Eggshell Oechsle, a primitive existentialist; of Stump Bonomo, Champion of the Tri-County Finger League; of Doc Rice, reluctant dentist; of Jake the Fake, Gyp the Blood, Lemonears Behind the Brewery, and the rest of the boys at Brolly&#39;s Bar and the Majestic Pocket Billiards. Andoshen, Pa. is the touching story of a tough, often violent, coal town entirely undermined and sinking more rapidly than the jewel of the Adriatic. The poverty of Andoshen is as rich as that of Tortilla Flat or Cannery Row. It is a new and unique addition to the literary map of the world. DARRYL PONICSAN brings to this novel the same curious, compassionate irony that made his other books, The Last Detail and Goldengrove, so highly acclaimed.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9241"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=_3agDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Last Detail" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Last Detail</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Darryl Ponicsán<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Skyhorse</span><span><span> - </span>9/5/2017</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Unlike other branches of the armed services, the Navy draws it police force from the ranks, as temporary duty called Shore Patrol.

Darryl Ponicsan&#39;s debut novel The Last Detail was named one of the best of the year and widely acclaimed, catapulting him to fame when it was first published. The story of two career sailors assigned to escort a young seaman from Norfolk to the naval prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire—and of the mayhem that ensues—was made into an award-winning movie starring Jack Nicholson. Last Flag Flying, set thirty-four years after the events of The Last Detail, brings together the same beloved characters—Billy Bad-Ass Buddusky, Mule Mulhall, and Meadows—to reprise the same journey but under very different circumstances. Now middle-aged, Meadows seeks out his former captors in their civilian lives to help him bury his son, a Marine killed in Iraq, in Arlington National Cemetery. When he learns that the authorities have told him a lie about the circumstances of his son&#39;s death, he decides, with the help of the two others, to transport him home to Portsmouth. And so begins the journey, centered around a solemn mission but, as in the first book, a protest against injustice and celebration of life too, at once irreverent, funny, profane, and deeply moving. Last Flag Flying is now a major movie from Amazon Studios, directed by Richard Linklater and starring Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, and Laurence Fishburne.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb9243"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Last Detail</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Darryl Ponicsan<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->12/1/2004</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Unlike other branches of the armed services, the navy draws its police force from the ranks, as temporary duty. The risk is that men on Shore Patrol might bring their humanity to the task. This accounts for the underlying tension in &quot;The Last Detail,&quot; which takes place during the height of the Vietnam War. Billy Bad-Ass and Mule Mulhall, two career sailors in transit in Norfolk, awaiting permanent orders, are given a detail: &quot;chaser&quot; duty. Their assignment is to escort and deliver Larry Meadows, an 18-year-old sailor, from Norfolk to Portsmouth, N. H., where he is to serve an eight year sentence in the brig. It&#39;s good duty, on the face of it, until the two old salts realize the injustice of the sentence and are oddly affected by the true innocence of their prisoner, even though he is guilty as charged. Failure, or refusal, to carry out their duty is never a question, no matter how much they may hate the detail or how wrong it seems, and yet something must be done, some gesture made in order to help their hapless prisoner survive the long ordeal he faces, and to purge their sense of shame. &quot;The Last Detail&quot; was Darryl Ponicsan&#39;s first book and it catapulted him into the front rank of American novelists. It was made into the 1973 film starring Jack Nicholson, and has become a classic of the Golden Age of American cinema. This new edition of &quot;The Last Detail&quot; coincides with the publication of its long-awaited sequel, &quot;Last Flag Flying,&quot; also available from Wright Press.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI0M2M2MzgtZGVjYS00ODZkLWI4NTEtYzEyNzUzYzgxMTM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster The Last Detail" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie The Last Detail is based on the book The Last Detail? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Two bawdy, tough looking navy lifers - &quot;Bad-Ass&quot; Buddusky, and &quot;Mule&quot; Mulhall - are commissioned to escort a young pilferer named Meadows to the brig in Portsmouth. Meadows is not much of a thief. Indeed, in his late teens, he is not much of a man at all. His great crime was to try to steal forty dollars from the admiral&#39;s wife&#39;s pet charity. For this, he&#39;s been sentenced to eight years behind bars. At first, Buddusky and Mulhall view the journey as a paid vacation, but their holiday spirits are quickly depressed by the prisoner, who looks prepared to break into tears at any moment. And he has the lowest self-image imaginable. Buddusky gets it into his head to give Meadows a good time and teach him a bit about getting on in the world. Lesson one: Don&#39;t take every card life deals you. Next, he teaches Meadows to drink, and, as a coup de grace, finds a nice young whore to instruct him in lovemaking. Mule, who worries aloud about his own position with military authority, seems pleased with Meadows&#39;s progress. However, when the trio reach Portsmouth, the game comes abruptly to an end as reality sets in.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">7.5/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">89%</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Metacritic:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">89/100</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about The Last Detail, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
