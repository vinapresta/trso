The film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place.The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named, \"The Hungry Bachelors Club\". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover. Fox gives an understated and touching performance and Nunn is reliably talented as always. Micheal des Barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney. The ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life. This is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.",slug:"the-hungry-bachelors-club"}}},books:{data:[{id:8078,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Lynn Scott Myers"],firstBook:true,published:"1994-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940971934}}("","The Hungry Bachelors Club"))
