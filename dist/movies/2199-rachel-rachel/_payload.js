She lives in the small town of Japonica, Connecticut where she grew up. She teaches second grade at Japonica Elementary School and lives with her highly demanding widowed mother (her funeral director father passed away fourteen years ago) in the same apartment above a funeral home where she grew up, despite the home now not being owned by them. Rachel often uses her mother as an excuse not to do things. Rachel represses her emotions, and is prone to daydreaming to envision alternate paths for herself in certain situations if she only had the nerve to do those things. Even when Nick Kazlik, a childhood acquaintance who has returned to Japonica for a summer visit with his family, makes it clear that he wants to have fun with her while he's in town, she can't act on his request out of fear of the unknown. But after a couple of incidents with her only real friend Calla Mackie, who is a fellow teacher at the school, Rachel begins to allow herself more freedom. But as Rachel's repressions slowly melt away, how her emotions will manifest themselves becomes the question.",slug:"rachel-rachel"}}},books:{data:[{id:1425,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:c}},{id:1426,attributes:{title:g,description:h,thumbnail:i,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:c}},{id:1427,attributes:{title:"Recognition and Revelation",description:"Margaret Laurence, best known for her germinal novels set in the Canadian prairies, is one of the nation's most respected authors. She was also an accomplished essayist, yet today her nonfiction writing is largely unavailable and therefore little known. In Recognition and Revelation Nora Foster Stovel brings together Laurence's short nonfiction works, including many that have not previously been collected and some that have never before been published. These works, including over fifty essays and addresses that span Laurence's writing career from the 1960s to the 1980s, reveal her passionate concern for Canadian literature and for the land and peoples of Canada. Based on extensive archival research, Stovel's introduction contextualizes Laurence's nonfiction writings in her life as a creative artist and political activist and as a woman writing in the twentieth century. The texts range from essays on Laurence's own writings and on other works of Canadian literature to autobiographical essays, several focusing on environmental concerns, to sociopolitical essays and writing advocating for peace and nuclear disarmament. By revealing Laurence as a socially and politically committed artist, this collection of lively and provocative essays illuminates the undercurrents of her creative writing and places her fiction - often informed by her nonfiction writing - in a new light.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=EOfoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2020-09-23",publisher:"McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP",subtitle:"Short Nonfiction Writings"}},{id:1428,attributes:{title:"Heart of a Stranger",description:"Heart of a Stranger, originally published in 1976, is a travelogue chronicling Laurence's geographical journeys to many lands and places.

Rachel Cameron, thirty-four and unmarried, is trapped by the stifling conventionality of small-town Canadian life as a shy, retiring schoolmistress and dependable helpmeet to her coy and overbearing invalid mother. Desperate for love and companionship, she risks all in an affair with a man for whom sex and love are more trivial matters- and it changes Rachel's life in unforseen ways.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=gAjds6OO9NAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1993-11-15","University of Chicago Press"))
