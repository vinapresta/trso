Now, more than fifty of his essays have been collected in How Not to Be A Doctor. Taken together, they set out an argument that being a doctor—a real doctor—should mean being able to draw on every aspect of yourself, your interests, and your experiences, however remote these may seem from the medical task of the moment.Originating from popular columns Launer has written for medical journals, the essays range from the title essay “How Not to Be A Doctor,†? an ironic piece illustrating how being authentic as a doctor may mean behaving in ways you were never taught in medical school, to a story of the imagined conversation between two prehistoric medical men on the primitive diet, to the author’s poignant account of being a patient himself as he received treatment for a life-threatening illness. Some of the essays take the form of short stories, either imaginary or autobiographical, and some are contemplative in tone, while others are polemical, humorous, educational, fantastical, satirical, or dead serious. They cover a range of topics including music, poetry, literature, and psychoanalysis, as well as contemporary medical politics and the personal experiences of being a doctor. From the absurd to the profound, the short stories, essays, and reflections in How Not to Be a Doctor combine erudition with humor, candor, and the human touch to show how, in medicine, you cannot separate personal experiences from professional ones, and to inform and entertain readers on both sides of the stethoscope.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UTuEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["John Launer"],firstBook:c,published:"2018-05-15",publisher:"Abrams",subtitle:"And Other Essays"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531320374}}("movie","series",null,"John Kerr",1,"A Dangerous Method","A Most Dangerous Method","“Has all the elements of a juicy novel . . . riveting. . . .

Six years later they were bitter antagonists, locked in a savage struggle that was as much personal and emotional as it was theoretical and professional. Between them stood a young woman named Sabina Spielrein, who had been both patient and lover to Jung and colleague and confidante to Freud before going on to become an innovative psychoanalyst herself. With the narrative power and emotional impact of great tragedy, A Dangerous Method is impossible to put down.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GbWFzct0bfgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-02-23","Vintage","The Story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein"))
