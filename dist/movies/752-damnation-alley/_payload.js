Fans discovered for the first time that Amber is not the one true world of which all others are but Shadows. Rather, the mysterious Courts of Chaos preceded the creation of Amber. It was also revealed that the mad mage Dworkin was the father of Oberon, founder of Amber’s ruling dynasty, and that Dworkin’s origins go further back in time than the founding of Amber itself. The Dawn of Amber is a prequel series, exploring events that precede the first novel in the series, that answers these intriguing questions. Here, in Book One, you’ll meet the young soldier known as Obere as he’s whisked away from the kingdom and world he has known and defended his entire life, and placed on a knife’s edge of turmoil, intrigue, domination and death. He must learn what he can on the fly, unwilling to let friend and foe alike know how little he understands of this strange universe and the dangerous creatures that rule it. His life is in jeopardy, as is the entire House of Dworkin—the result of an ages-old blood feud that threatens to destroy Obere’s new-found family and any hope for a universe of light to balance and oppose the forces of Chaos and darkness. To achieve his legacy of power and become a player rather than a pawn in this deadly game whose rules he is yet to discover, Obere must journey into the serpent’s lair, the home of his enemies . . . the Courts of Chaos.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=adOCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[l],firstBook:d,published:"2011-02-11",publisher:c,subtitle:a}},{id:4842,attributes:{title:"Roger Zelazny's Chaos and Amber (HC)",description:"In CHAOS AND AMBER, Dworkin and his son Oberon arrive at the Courts of Chaos to discover, and confront, their hidden enemies. But things don't go as planned. Oberon has a terrible physical reaction to being in Chaos, while assassination attempts are made on both his and Dworkin's lives—and the traitor in their family remains a hidden but quite real threat. Dworkin takes Oberon on a desperate journey, pressing deeper into Shadow than ever before. Here, Oberon discovers more of the true nature of his father...and of his real mother.

Facing life in prison for his various crimes, he's given a choice: Rot away his remaining years in a tiny jail cell, or drive cross-country and deliver a case of antiserum to the plague-ridden people of Boston, Massachusetts. The chance of a full pardon does wonders for getting his attention. And don't mistake this mission of mercy for any kind of normal road trip-not when there are radioactive storms, hordes of carnivorous beasts, and giant, mutated scorpions to be found along every deadly mile between Los Angeles and the East Coast.
