A pickpocket promptly relieves him of his money, and he nearly starves before Queen Lil takes him under her wing, gives him a room in her high-class bordello, and gets him a job at a newspaper. He's so sweet and dumb, he thinks Lil's is a boarding house. He's soon caught up in an electoral struggle between a secretly corrupt reformer and an openly corrupt councilman.

An alcoholic investigative reporter and the bordello's ingénue try to help him grow up.",slug:"gaily-gaily"}}},books:{data:[{id:6686,attributes:{title:c,description:"With the vigor and gusto invariably associated with his personality and his works, Ben Hecht recreates in this volume the lusty Chicago of the early twentieth century, as seen from its underside by a cub reporter on a great metropolitan daily. He introduces the reader to a vast cast of eccentric characters-bums, criminals, prostitutes, politicians, and poets, not to mention the police. He conducts you to the scenes of the crimes. He invites you to the courtroom and the murderer’s solitary cell and to the gallows. He lets you sit around with him in the city room of a great Chicago newspaper, where he collected considerable material for that newspaper classic, The Front Page, which he wrote in collaboration with Charles MacArthur. Some of these stories are bizarre. Most of them are bawdy. But they are all imbued with lusty vitality and with a kind of innocent wonder that life is really so much stranger than fiction. The author looks back on the whole era with the consistently-unchanged fresh eye of youth. He is less concerned with nostalgia than reporting the way it was.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7vSuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:"2018-12-12",publisher:"Pickle Partners Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:6687,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1966-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:6688,attributes:{title:"Ben Hecht Filmscript Collection",description:"Filmscripts as well as material associated with those scripts, dating from early treatments of The Paradine case in 1933 (later a 1947 Hitchcock film on which Hecht worked uncredited) to a 1968 screenplay by Abram S. Ginnes based on a collection of Hecht pieces entitled Gaily, gaily. The scripts and other writing in this collection for which Hecht received credit are: A farewell to arms, Monkey business (originally, Darling, I am growing younger), Notorious, Ride a pink horse, Spellbound, and Wuthering heights. The bulk of the collection consists of material associated with Hecht’s Hollywood career as an uncredited script doctor, most notably Duel in the sun, Gone with the wind, The Paradine case, and Portrait of Jennie. The two manuscript items relating to Gone with the wind are interesting: a shooting script for the first part of the movie with copious penciled annotations, and four production memos written on Selznick International Pictures, Inc. stationery. These two items, plus the final shooting script for Ride a pink horse, are boxed separately and placed at the end of the collection. The range of material includes not only scripts in various stages, but such miscellaneous items as cutting and dialogue continuity, Spanish dialogue, footage schedules, physical descriptions, story treatments, music lists, outlines, research, publicity handouts and trailer continuity.",thumbnail:a,authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1933-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:6689,attributes:{title:c,description:"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

For 22 weeks, Ben Hecht held forth on a variety of subjects, enraging some, engaging many. Here is a sample of Hechts stories and essays from his short-lived television show.
