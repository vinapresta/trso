One of the Best Books of the Year: The Washington Post, NPR, Vogue, BookRiot Fiona Maye is a leading High Court judge who presides over cases in the family division. She is renowned for her fierce intelligence, exactitude, and sensitivity. But her professional success belies private sorrow and domestic strife. There is the lingering regret of her childlessness, and now her marriage of thirty years is in crisis. At the same time, she is called on to try an urgent case: Adam, a beautiful seventeen-year-old boy, is refusing for religious reasons the medical treatment that could save his life, and his devout parents echo his wishes. Time is running out. Should the secular court overrule sincerely expressed faith? In the course of reaching a decision, Fiona visits Adam in the hospitalâ€”an encounter that stirs long-buried feelings in her and powerful new emotions in the boy. Her judgment has momentous consequences for them both.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JzRcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2014-09-09","Anchor","Penguin Readers Level 7: The Children Act (ELT Graded Reader)","Penguin Readers is an ELT graded reader series for learners of English as a foreign language.
