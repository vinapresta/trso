Twelve years after Hannah Hunnicutt was committed to a Dallas asylum, her body is brought home to northeast Texas to be buried alongside those of her husband and son. Etched on all three gravestones is the same date of death: May 28, 1939. Home from the Hill is the story of that tragic day and the dramatic events leading up to it. The biggest landowner in the county, Captain Wade Hunnicutt was a charismatic war hero whose legendary hunting skills extended to the wives of his friends and neighbors. Humiliated by her husband’s philandering, Hannah grew to despise Captain Wade but was too proud to ask for a divorce; instead, she devoted herself to her only child. Torn between his mother’s adoration and an overwhelming need to win his father’s approval, Theron tried to become his own man. And he might have succeeded if he hadn’t fallen in love with the beautiful and innocent Libby Halstead. William Humphrey’s dazzling debut novel, the inspiration for a major motion picture starring Robert Mitchum, is a masterpiece of twentieth-century American literature, as intense and thrilling as the Hunnicutts themselves.

In “The Last Husband,” a bright-eyed newlywed bears witness to the cynical intrigues of an older married couple. “The Human Fly” is the darkly humorous story of a young man’s misguided attempt to create a new identity for himself in the rural Texas community where his name has become a running joke. “Quail for Mr. Forester” is the tender and precisely detailed portrait of a young Southern boy yearning for the glorious past he never knew. In “The Rainmaker,” a self-proclaimed professor of the elements is tarred, feathered, and run out of town for raising a dust storm instead of delivering the promised downpour. He escapes across the Red River and finally succeeds in bringing an end to the drought, only to be forced to flee yet again when a three-day deluge results in disastrous flooding. Marked by the same originality and artistry that distinguished Home from the Hill and The Ordways as two of the finest novels in American literature, The Collected Stories of William Humphrey is a testament to the breathtaking scope of its author’s vision and the graceful precision of his craft.

In the aftermath of his son’s suicide, Ben Curtis returns to the upstate New York fishing lodge that holds some of his happiest memories. It has been two years since his last visit, and Ben—thirty pounds lighter, his dark hair turned white—is barely recognizable to people who have fished alongside him for twenty summers. For the first time in all those years, he has made the trip alone. Over the course of the weekend, as Ben tramps through the forest and relearns the secrets of catching trout, he recalls the joys of the past and reckons with the grim reality of the present. Anthony, a Princeton freshman who inherited his father’s love of the outdoors, is gone. So too is the man he was named after: Tony Thayer, Ben’s best friend and former fishing companion. And Ben has no idea where his wife, Cathy, might be. In the wake of Anthony’s death, their already-strained marriage fell apart. Where does a man turn when everything he put his faith in—friends, family, love—is destroyed? In the exhilaration of fly casting into an icy mountain stream, Ben hopes to find the answer. Hailed by the Chicago Tribune as “a desperate, impressive, astonishing book,” Hostages to Fortune is a profound and deeply moving meditation on the art of survival.

When the Renshaw matriarch, Edwina, takes to her deathbed, her ten children are summoned home to stand vigil. Past humiliations and long-simmering resentments soon boil to the surface—a son’s forbidden love affair destroyed by his imperious mother, a daughter’s dutiful attentions greeted with nothing but disdain. But the most painful wound of all is the absence of Kyle, Edwina’s favorite son and the only member of the family to leave Texas. What drove him away, and can his siblings get him home in time to see his mother before she dies? As the ties that bind the indomitable Renshaws stretch and fray, Proud Flesh builds to a stunning climax of passion and violence. It is an unforgettable story, and one of William Humphrey’s finest.
