He’s a twenty-five-year-old scholar\u002Fathlete from an upper-class family who was recruited by his godfather to work for a U.S. intelligence agency. On a covert mission in a Somali village, he delivers cash and cell phones to Hatashil, a legendary orphan warrior turned rebel leader. It’s a routine assignment until, minutes after they meet, the village is decimated by a missile assault, and although Mike escapes, his life is changed forever. Echoing across continents, the assault disrupts professor Susan Lowell, who has just won a Pulitzer Prize for her book celebrating Hatashil. Also shaken is Lowell’s student, David Ayan, who was born in the targeted village, a world away from Harvard’s most exclusive final club, the Porcellian, which is courting him and Jane, the smart, risk-taking daughter of East Coast money who’s sleeping with him. David Ayan struggles with his identity and Susan Lowell struggles against rumors about her relationship with Hatashil, who has been accused of ordering the village massacre. But it is Mike Teak who faces the most dangerous struggle—because when he discovers a horrific conspiracy, he immediately realizes that he has become expendable, with nowhere to run and no one to trust. “It's clear this young writer has only begun to show where his prodigious storytelling will take us.” —People “Smart and sexy.” —The Washington Post “Tempered by some hilarious insider glimpses of Harvard life, An Expensive Education is terrific, a thriller noir that's difficult to put down or forget.\" —Entertainment Weekly (A-)",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dq7SDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2010-05-04",publisher:g,subtitle:b}},{id:1632,attributes:{title:"The Third Brother",description:"A young man interning for a newspaper in Hong Kong finds himself in Thailand searching for a missing journalist and also exploring his own identity amid the steamy streets and illicit pleasures of Bangkok.

The kids of Twelve have it all; Chris and Claude and Hunter and Laura have the best, and most, of everything, but are constantly looking for something more exotic, and more dangerous. But Twelve is not a coming-of-age story, because these kids never had a childhood—their parents are off on holiday in Bali or business in Brussels, leaving hired help to look the other way as the kids stay home alone in their multimillion-dollar town houses, partying, surrounded by drugs and sex—and, in the end, much worse. “Renders Manhattan’s cosseted Upper East Side with both the casual authority of an insider and the wry distance of an observer…impressive.”—Jennifer Egan, The New York Times Book Review “Riveting in its no-holds-barred depiction of teenage nihilism.”—Jon Land, Providence Journal","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=rK7SDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2010-07-06"))
