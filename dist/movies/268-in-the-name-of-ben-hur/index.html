He becomes a successful charioteer.The story&#39;s revenge plot becomes a story of compassion and forgiveness. The novel is divided into eight books, or parts, each with its own subchapters. Book one opens with the story of the three biblical Magi, who arrive in Bethlehem to hear the news of Christ&#39;s birth. Readers meet the fictional character of Judah for the first time in book two, when his childhood friend Messala, also a fictional character, returns home as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The teen-aged boys come to realize that they have changed and hold very different views and aspirations. When a loose tile is accidentally dislodged from the roof of Judah&#39;s house during a military parade and strikes the Roman governor, knocking him from his horse, Messala falsely accuses Judah of attempted assassination. Although Judah is not guilty and receives no trial, he is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned in a Roman jail, where they contract leprosy; and all the family property is confiscated. Judah first encounters Jesus, who offers him a drink of water and encouragement, as Judah is being marched to slavery aboard a galley. Their lives continue to intersect as the story unfolds. In book three Judah survives his ordeal as a galley slave through good fortune, which includes befriending and saving the commander of his ship, who later adopts him. Judah goes on to become a trained soldier and charioteer. In books four and five Judah returns home to Jerusalem to seek revenge and redemption for his family.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div></section><section><h2 class="bg-trso-blue text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-center font-serif px-4 mb-2">Related books / From the author(s)</h2><div class="flex flex-wrap"><!--[--><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2859"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=k7jEjwEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Ben-Hur" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Ben-Hur</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lew Wallace<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Createspace Independent Publishing Platform</span><span><span> - </span>5/10/2016</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>Ben-Hur is a heroic story of a fictional hero named Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish nobleman who was falsely accused of an attempted assassination and enslaved by the Romans.

Generations have thrilled to the sacred destiny of the mighty charioteer Ben-Hur, whose enduring tale began as a bestselling 1880 novel that later inspired equally popular stage and film interpretations. Combining the appeal of a historical adventure with a heartfelt message of Christian love and compassion, the story blends the visceral excitement of a quest for vengeance with the spiritual thrill of forgiveness. Author Lew Wallace―a Civil War general, politician, and diplomat―conducted meticulous research into the ancient world to bring a vivid immediacy to his characters and settings, from life as a Roman galley slave, to the living death of exile, to a Jerusalem leper colony. The novel&#39;s countless admirers included President James A. Garfield, a former professor of literature, who told the author, &quot;With this beautiful and reverent book you have lightened the burden of my daily life.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2861"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><!----><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Ben-Hur; a Tale of the Christ</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lew Lew Wallace<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->7/23/2017</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>How is this book unique?

Considered &quot;the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century&quot;, it became a best-selling American novel, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe&#39;s Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin (1852) in sales. The book also inspired other novels with biblical settings and was adapted for the stage and motion picture productions. Ben-Hur remained at the top of the bestseller lists until the publication of Margaret Mitchell&#39;s Gone with the Wind (1936). Following the release of the 1959 MGM film adaptation of Ben-Hur, which was seen by tens of millions and won eleven Academy Awards in 1960, the book&#39;s sales increased and it surpassed Gone with the Wind. Blessed by Pope Leo XIII, the novel was the first work of fiction to be so honored. The success of the novel and its stage and film adaptations also helped it become a popular cultural icon that was used to promote numerous commercial products.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2862"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Tc2DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Ben-Hur (A Tale of the Christ)" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Ben-Hur (A Tale of the Christ)</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lew Wallace<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by e-artnow</span><span><span> - </span>9/5/2016</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>This carefully crafted ebook: &quot;Ben-Hur (A Tale of the Christ)” is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Ben-Hur describes the adventures of Judah Ben-Hur, Jewish prince from Jerusalem who gets betrayed by his friend from childhood and enslaved by the Romans. He is taken to Rome where he becomes a charioteer and a Christian. Running in parallel with Judah&#39;s narrative is the unfolding story of Jesus, who comes from the same region and is a similar age. The novel reflects themes of betrayal, conviction, and redemption, with a revenge plot that leads to a story of love and compassion. Lew Wallace (1827-1905) was an American lawyer, Union general in the American Civil War, politician, diplomat, and author. Among his novels and biographies, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, a bestselling novel that has been called &quot;the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century.&quot;</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb2863"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=SU81UdqUDrYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Ben-Hur" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Ben-Hur</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Lew Wallace<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->1/1/1880</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>A wealthy young Jew and his family experience changing fortunes under Roman tyranny are affected by the life and teachings of a Nazarene named Jesus Christ.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU3NjczNjQtYzBjMy00YTAxLTg0NzctZmVmMDY0MGE3Nzc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA3MjE1MzM@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster In the Name of Ben Hur" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie In the Name of Ben Hur is based on the book Ben-Hur? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Retired gladiator Juda Ben Hur helps a group of young vigilantes in their quest to remove the Romans from their homeland once and for all.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">2.8/10</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Ben-Hur, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
