On the heels of a new double edition of his steamy noirs Epitaph for a Tramp and Epitaph for a Deadbeat comes a new edition of his 1965 classic The Ballad of Dingus Magee, whose subtitle — \"Immortal True Saga of the Most Notorious and Desperate Bad Man of the Olden Days, his Blood–Shedding, his Ruination of Poor Helpless Females, & Cetera\" — gives readers a hint of the raucous sensibility at work here. Brimming with blasphemy, bullets, and bordellos, this hilarious tale, which inspired the Frank Sinatra movie Dirty Dingus McGee, shows the early Markson at his outrageous best, taking down, as Playboy put it, \"the breeches of the Old West and blast[ing] what's exposed with buckshot.\"",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=qzggAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2008-05-28",publisher:"Counterpoint",subtitle:a}},{id:5254,attributes:{title:g,description:"Satire on westerns which concerns a cowardly sheriff and a clever but not very violent outlaw.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=L7aGAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1965-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Being the Immortal True Saga of the Most Notorious and Desperate Bad Man of the Olden Days, His Blood-shedding, His Ruination of Poor Helpless Females, & Cetera"}},{id:5255,attributes:{title:"The Last Novel",description:"In recent novels, which have been called \"hypnotic,\" \"stunning,\" and \"exhilarating,\" David Markson has created his own personal genre. In this new work, The Last Novel, an elderly author (referred to only as \"Novelist\") announces that since this will be his final effort, he has \"carte blanche to do anything he damned well pleases.\" Pressed by solitude and age, Novelist's preoccupations inevitably turn to the stories of other artists — their genius, their lack of recognition, and their deaths. Keeping his personal history out of the story as much as possible, Novelist creates an incantatory stream of fascinating triumphs and failures from the lives of famous and not–so–famous painters, writers, musicians, sports figures, and scientists. As Novelist moves through his last years, a minimalist self–portrait emerges, becoming an intricate masterpiece from David Markson's astonishing imagination. Through these startling, sometimes comic, but often tragic anecdotes we unexpectedly discern the entire shape of a man's life.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ktoREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2007-05-10",publisher:"Catapult",subtitle:a}},{id:5256,attributes:{title:"The Ballad of Dingus Magee, Etc",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1967-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:5257,attributes:{title:"Vanishing Point",description:"In a new novel that playfully deconstructs the novel, the author exposes himself--and the absurdities and tragedies of the creative life--in a funny, satirical, sometimes painful sendup of the novelist at work.
