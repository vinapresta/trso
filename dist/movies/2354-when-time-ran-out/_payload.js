David Morton and his new Hammer Force—an intelligence agency created by the United Nations after the carnage in Bosnia—have a formidable task. To avert a world crisis, they must win a deadly, invisible battle for control of the mind of the president of the United States. A weapon has been created by the former Soviet Union’s most brilliant scientist, Professor Igor Tamasara, that is designed to trigger responses in the president that will pit the United States and Japan against each other, leading to World War III. From that conflict, Tamasara’s new paymaster—China—will emerge as the superpower of the twenty-first century. Set against the background of Washington, Beijing, and Hong Kong, this highly original and totally credible futuristic thriller builds to a climax of nail-biting suspense. Once more showing an astonishing command of the inner workings of international politics and the world of secret intelligence, Gordon Thomas has created a first-rate work of fiction featuring unforgettable characters. “Morton is a character who could have been created by Forsyth, le Carré or Ludlum. You will read any of his adventures in one sitting.” —Le Monde",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TMbjAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:f}},{id:11443,attributes:{title:"Deadly Perfume",description:"In this breakneck thriller, the New York Times–bestselling author introduces Mossad agent David Morton—a man as dangerous as the terrorists he hunts. In the aftermath of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, a megalomaniac terrorist holds the world hostage, threatening to poison every major city with a deadly virus. He has the means—a form of anthrax capable of wiping out millions in minutes—and demonstrates its potency by adding a small vial of it to the drinking water in a small South African town, killing all of the inhabitants. With only seven days to meet his demands, the world’s leaders call on David Morton, a brilliant and ruthless Mossad agent. The result is a tense global chase, leading from China to Athens, London, Libya, South Africa, Tel Aviv, and New York, drawing good and evil closer and closer in a battle to the death. Deadly Perfume penetrates the real world of intelligence-gathering to reveal its secret subculture, with its hidden loyalties and agendas. Gordon Thomas has imagined a world so terrifyingly real that it poses the question, Is it imagined at all? “[A] horribly convincing thriller . . . Intelligence agent David Morton deals with the psychodynamics of terrorism, with modern technology at his fingertips and the ears of Western politicians at his command. I was left hoping that we have some real Mortons at our disposal.” —Daily Mail",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_8TjAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:f}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568379748}}("Gordon Thomas","movie","2014-07-01","Open Road Media",null,"","series",1,"The Day the World Ended","The true story of a horrifying natural disaster—and the corruption that made it worse—by the New York Times–bestselling authors of Voyage of the Damned. In late April 1902, Mount Pelée, a volcano on the Caribbean island Martinique, began to wake up. It emitted clouds of ash and smoke for two weeks until violently erupting on May 8. Over 30,000 residents of St. Pierre were killed; they burned to death under rivers of hot lava and suffocated under pounds of hot ash. Only three people managed to survive: a prisoner trapped in a dungeon-like jail cell, a man on the outskirts of town, and a young girl found floating unconscious in a boat days later. So how did a town of thousands not heed the warnings of nature and local scientists, instead staying behind to perish in the onslaught of volcanic ash? Why did the newspapers publish articles assuring readers that the volcano was harmless? And why did the authorities refuse to allow the American Consul to contact Washington about the conditions? The answer lies in politics: With an election on the horizon, the political leaders of Martinique ignored the welfare of their people in order to consolidate the votes they needed to win. A gripping and informative book on the disastrous effects of a natural disaster coupled with corruption, The Day the World Ended reveals the story of a city engulfed in flames and the political leaders that chose to kill their people rather than give up their political power.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=M5O4AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Max Morgan-Witts","The Mount Pelée Disaster: May 7, 1902"))
