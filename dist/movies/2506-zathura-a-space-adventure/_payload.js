Twelve-year-old Walter Budwing (Josh Hutcherson) and his younger brother, Danny (Jonah Bobo), figure they're going to be in for a boring time when their father (Tim Robbins), who was supposed to spend the day with them, is suddenly called away on business, and gives them strict orders not to leave the house. Walter, who doesn't have much use for Danny, is motivated by boredom more than anything else when he agrees to play a board game Danny has found in the basement during a round of hide-and-seek. However, the boys quickly discover the space-themed game Zathura has some unusual qualities -- a roll of the dice unexpectedly launches the Budwing home into outer space, and Walter and Danny are suddenly fending off menacing robots, angry aliens, and showers of interstellar debris outside the Earth's atmosphere. As the boys try to figure out a way back home, they get some unexpected help from an earthling astronaut (Dax Shepard) who has also lost his way.",slug:"zathura-a-space-adventure"}}},books:{data:[{id:12060,attributes:{title:e,description:"Left on their own for an evening, two boisterous brothers find more excitement than they bargained for in a mysterious and mystical space adventure board game.",thumbnail:b,authors:["Chris Van Allsburg"],firstBook:true,published:"2020-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:"A Space Adventure"}},{id:12061,attributes:{title:e,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:["David Koepp","John Kamps"],firstBook:f,published:"2004-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:"A Space Adventure : Screenplay"}},{id:12062,attributes:{title:"The Sci-Fi Movie Guide",description:"Once upon a time, science fiction was only in the future. It was the stuff of drive-ins and cheap double-bills. Then, with the ever-increasing rush of new, society-altering technologies, science fiction pushed its way to the present, and it busted out of the genre ghetto of science fiction and barged its way into the mainstream. What used to be mere fantasy (trips to the moon? Wristwatch radios? Supercomputers capable of learning?) are now everyday reality. Whether nostalgic for the future or fast-forwarding to the present, The Sci-Fi Movie Guide: The Universe of Film from Alien to Zardoz covers the broad and widening range of science-fiction movies. From the trashy to the epic, from the classics to today's blockbusters, this cinefile’s guidebook reviews nearly 1,000 of the biggest, baddest, and brightest from every age and genre of cinematic and TV science fiction. You’ll find more than just Star Wars, Star Trek, and Transformers, with reviews on many overlooked and under-appreciated gems and genres, such as ... • Monsters! Pacific Rim, Godzilla, The Thing, Creature from the Black Lagoon • Superheroes: Thor, Iron Man, X-Men, The Amazing Spider-man, Superman • Avant-garde masterpieces: Solaris, 2001, Brazil • and many, many more categories and movies!!",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=G4GDBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Chris Barsanti"],firstBook:f,published:"2014-09-22",publisher:"Visible Ink Press",subtitle:"The Universe of Film from Alien to Zardoz"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069436443}}("movie","","series",1,"Zathura",null))
