Summary of the Book When Alex hears his uncle proclaim that they are about to embark on a quest to find a crater, he is surprised. For one thing, it means leaving his betrothed to go on a mad quest. For another, it means going to Iceland to find a certain crater that leads down into a mysterious world. But Professor Lidenbrock is a hard man to ignore. Fuelled by the spirit of adventure, Alex leaves with Lidenbrock to find this mysterious crater which will take them to a world below the surface. They hire a guide called Hans who takes them to the volcano. Down one of its three craters, these three travellers find a majestic world hidden for centuries, even millennia. Here, prehistoric creatures roam free, and a huge species of man walks upright. Here, there is a large ocean where Palaeolithic creatures rule undeterred by the passage of time. If these three travellers can return home, this discovery will make them rich and famous beyond their wildest dreams. But then again, to do so they will have to find a way out of this world. And so far, there doesn’t seem to be one.
