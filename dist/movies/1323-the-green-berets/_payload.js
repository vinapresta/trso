From Vietnam to the present day, The Wars of the Green Berets retells the stranger-than-fiction, hair-raising experiences of the stout men who have risked it all, from their firefights on the Cambodian border to their present-day patrols on the dangerous streets of Baghdad. It takes us to the streets of Mogadishu in the days before and after the events of Black Hawk Down. It puts us on the rocky moonscapes of Afghanistan in search of the enemy, where soldiers face the dangers of friendly fire as well as fierce Taliban fighters. Featuring a new foreword by a former Green Beret about the continued efforts and role Special Forces play in modern warfare, this is a work of fiction that is more real than many works of history. It’s destined to become a classic.

Though fictionalized, The Green Berets exposed the American public to the horrors of the ground war in Vietnam, and gave the men of the Green Berets the recognition they deserved. Here is the tale of the courageous South Vietnamese girl posing as an anti-American Communist to capture the Viet Cong officer who murdered her family. Here is the graft and double-dealing of South Vietnamese officers undercutting America’s war effort. More importantly, here are America’s soldiers showing unimaginable bravery in the face of a determined and deadly enemy. With a foreword by Major General Thomas R. Csrnko reflecting on the history and future of this elite fighting unit, The Green Berets stands as an enduring classic. “One of the most exciting war books.” —London Sunday Telegraph Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction—novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.
