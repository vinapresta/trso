There she meets the Willoughby family, rife with illicit alliances and vendettas.

Hideous Kinky follows two little English girls -- the five-year-old narrator and Bea, her seven-year-old sister -- as they struggle to establish some semblance of normal life on a trip to Morocco with their hippie mother, Julia. Once in Marrakech, Julia immerses herself in Sufism and her quest for personal fulfillment, while her daughters rebel -- the older by trying to recreate her English life, the younger by turning her hopes for a father on a most unlikely candidate. Shocking and wonderful, Hideous Kinky is at once melancholy and hopeful. A remarkable debut novel from one of England's finest young writers, Hideous Kinky was inspired by the author's own experiences as a child. Esther Freud, daughter of the artist Lucian Freud and great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, lived in Marrakech for one and a half years with her older sister Bella and her mother. Hideous Kinky is now a major motion picture starring Kate Winslet (\"Titanic,\" \"Sense and Sensibility\").","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=5TUqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2021-07-13","HarperCollins","A&C Black"))
