But by the time his Cadillac pulls into Enigma, he discovers an old friend is being held at tenuous bay from a lynch mob. As Harry Crews’s first novel unfolds, the Gospel Singer is forced to give way to his torment, and in doing so he reveals to the believers who have gathered at his feet just how little he is God’s man, and how much he has contributed to the corruption of each of them.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=8ng3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:i,subtitle:c}},{id:1046,attributes:{title:g,description:"Harry Crew recounts his childhood, focusing on the people, places, and circumstances that shaped him into the author he is today.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=GxROLxIJM7cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1995-01-01",publisher:"University of Georgia Press",subtitle:j}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703584213}}("Harry Crews","movie","",null,"series",1,"A Childhood","2022-03-15","Penguin","The Biography of a Place"))
