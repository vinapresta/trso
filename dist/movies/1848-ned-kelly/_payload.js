In days when an arrest equaled guilt and a conviction, his unfair imprisonment for horse thievery puts him steadfast, in the eyes of Victorian police, on the wrong side of things for life. With a sister unable to dissuade the unwanted advances of Constable Fitzpatrick, Ned, his brother Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart soon find themselves labeled \"an outlaw gang\" by the less-than-honorable constable. It's a designation they're apt to live up to after Ned's mother is unfairly arrested and sentenced to three years hard labor. In retaliation, the Kelly Gang strikes out against the oppressive Victorian government, with ultimately tragic results and passage into Australian folklore.",slug:"ned-kelly"}}},books:{data:[{id:9377,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=8_0gAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:i,publisher:"Pan MacMillan",subtitle:a}},{id:9378,attributes:{title:e,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:i,publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:9379,attributes:{title:h,description:"An action-packed historical novel about the legendary Australian gunfighter Ned Kelly follows the notorious outlaw and his gang of \"bushrangers\" on their violent rampage through the wilderness of Australia.
