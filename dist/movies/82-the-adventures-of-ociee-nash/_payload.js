It's not long before Ociee meets an array of interesting (and renowned) characters including the world's pioneering female investigative journalist Nellie Bly, Orville and Wilbur Wright, and even the President of the United States, William McKinley, for whom Ociee inspires a campaign slogan. When Ociee finally arrives in Asheville, she and Aunt Mamie discover that every story has two sides.

Ociee befriends the proper young Elizabeth Murphy and the pair soon get in over their heads with a trip to the creek and a daring meeting with Harry Vanderbilt and his friends.
