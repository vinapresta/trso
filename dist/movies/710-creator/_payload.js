And what could be more perfect to love than the Messiah, who now reappears in the prophesied Second Coming as a knockout young female. Declared to be the God of All Gods, She (her name is, in fact, She) beckons our protagonist, the somewhat bewildered Max Pincus, on a journey which is part Canterbury Tales and part, it becomes increasingly evident, a reworking of the New Testament, from virgin birth to Sermon on the Mount. Ultimately a love-story, along Pincus's journey to find the new young female Savior, he finds himself, not only attracting a growing cast of self-proclaimed apostles (who, it appears, are neither called nor chosen, but don't especially care), but encountering, as well, the formidable and gigantic - and perhaps lethal - Singing Machine, a device with a will of its own and a continually morphing and haunting song that leads all who join Pincus to seek out the new Savior, hoping that She will explain the song's true meaning, a desire that understandably requires them to drag the huge device along behind them wherever they go.But it is the budding romance between the Savior and Max Pincus that drives the story, as the so-called apostles attempt to determine whether She is, in fact, the Savior, in which case they have strong reservations about Pincus dating her. At the end, Leven ingeniously leaves us with a tale which suggests a world which might have been, had the true intentions of the Messiah been realized. It is a comedy of the highest order.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9R7QwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2019-01-02",publisher:"iCreator Press",subtitle:"A Comedy"}},{id:4641,attributes:{title:"Say Chic",description:"SAY CHIC...C'est magnifique! Ever wonder why some French words have become so common in English as to be clichés? Or why your witty repartee wouldn't be quite so witty without them? In Say Chic, Françoise Blanchard and Jeremy Leven collect more than seventy familiar French words and phrases that have become a permanent part of the American vocabulary. In their clever, often amusing style, the authors explain the origin of each word, its meaning, and how it came to be adopted into English. Uniting the sensibilities of an American author and a French author, these surprisingly entertaining stories combine world history, pop culture, etymology, and pithy observations about Americans and the French, with no small amount of panache. Featuring delightful illustrations, Say Chic will find its raison d'être on the bookshelf of anyone who has ever longed to be an American in Paris and hankers for a bit more of that irresistible je ne sais quoi in America.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pR-mzW5rJ8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Francoise Blanchard",c],firstBook:e,published:"2007-08-14",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:"A Collection of French Words We Can't Live Without"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531315860}}("","movie","Jeremy Leven","series",null,"Creator",1,"1983-01-01"))
