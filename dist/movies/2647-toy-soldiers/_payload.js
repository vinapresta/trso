When William Kennedy arrives in Barcelona, his guidebook recommends taking the trolley around town—but the trolleys haven’t run in the city for years. He’s on his way to interview the novelist Gabriel García Márquez when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees something impossible: a yellow trolley running down the street. Márquez, however, is not surprised; like all great writers of both fiction and nonfiction, he knows that impossible things happen every day. A remarkable collection from one of America’s greatest authors, Riding the Yellow Trolley Car features work from all stages of Kennedy’s career. Through each piece runs the thread that ties together his greatest works: a love and deep understanding of his hometown, the city of Albany, New York, and the good and evil men who have made it what it is. Featuring interviews and essays on some of the most prominent authors of the twentieth century, from Saul Bellow and E. L. Doctorow to Norman Mailer and the legendary García Márquez—as well as insightful reflections on topics from baseball to the death of a prominent cat to Kennedy’s wife’s hiccups—Riding the Yellow Trolley Car is an essential book for all those who love to read, or live to write.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=MBKfDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["William Kennedy"],firstBook:b,published:"2017-01-03",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:"Selected Nonfiction"}},{id:12672,attributes:{title:"Sergeant Kennedy's World War Ii Diary",description:"This is a journal spanning from October 30, 1942 to October 29th 1945 through which the author recounts his days abroad serving in the U.S. Army during WWII. Kennedy begins his memoir by admitting to a reluctance toward fighting in the war before bringing readers down a path fraught with detailed descriptions of life aboard a warship and in various countries around the world. Whether describing the war-littered desert streets of Tobruk, Africa, the grandeur of Rome, or the breathtaking sight of Capri, Italy, the author places readers deep into his penetrating remembrances. Kennedys forthright honesty and unique experiences will give readers insight into the harsh realities of being away from home and a new wife for three years, as well as an insight into the bonds of friendship and camaraderie that result from soldiers serving together. The pictures not only add a personal touch to an already moving memoir, but help readers match faces with the colorful characters about whom Kennedy writes.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=VTScQqsxZ0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["William M.
