In this novel, 22-year-old Anne has left college to serve as principal of Summerside High School and settles down in Windy Poplars. Anne has to overcome opposition to her presence from an influential family, the Pringles. The Pringles family make it well known she was not what they had hoped for in their new Prinicipal. She also finds new friends in Aunt Kate, Aunty Chatty and Rebecca Dew. This early work by Lucy Maud Montgomery was originally published in 1936 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. Lucy Maud Montgomery was born on 30th November 1874, New London, in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Her mother, Clara Woolner (Macneil), died before Lucy reached the age of two and so she was raised by her maternal grandparents in a family of wealthy Scottish immigrants. In 1908 Montgomery produced her first full-length novel, titled 'Anne of Green Gables'. It was an instant success, and following it up with several sequels, Montgomery became a regular on the best-seller list and an international household name. Montgomery died in Toronto on 24th April 1942.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-pJ9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:"2015-04-24",publisher:"Read Books Ltd",subtitle:b}},{id:2437,attributes:{title:h,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:k,publisher:l,subtitle:b}},{id:2438,attributes:{title:h,description:i,thumbnail:j,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:k,publisher:l,subtitle:b}},{id:2439,attributes:{title:"Anne of Green Gables",description:"Boxed Set Contains the following Titles: Anne of Ingleside; Anne's House of Dreams and Anne of Windy Poplars.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Od4MAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1997-10-01",publisher:"Starfire",subtitle:"Anne of Ingleside; Anne's House of Dreams; Anne of Windy Poplars"}},{id:2440,attributes:{title:e,description:"Anne Shirley has left Redmond College behind to begin a new job and a new chapter of her life away from Green Gables. Now she faces a new challenge: the Pringles. They're known as the royal family of Summerside - and they quickly let Anne know she is not the person they had wanted as principal of Summerside High School. But as she settles into the cozy tower room at Windy Poplars, Anne finds she has great allies in the widows Aunt Kate and Aunt Chatty - and in their irrepressible housekeeper, Rebecca Dew. As Anne learns Summerside's strangest secrets, winning the support of the prickly Pringles becomes only the first of her triumphs.\"Isn't that an address! Did you ever hear anything so delicious? Windy Poplars is the name of my new home and I love it. I also love Spook's Lane, which has no legal existence. It should be Trent Street but it is never called Trent Street except on the rare occasions when it is mentioned in the Weekly Courier ... and then people look at each other and say, 'Where on earth is that?' Spook's Lane it is ... although for what reason I cannot tell you. I have already asked Rebecca Dew about it, but all she can say is that it has always been Spook's Lane and there was some old yarn years ago of its being haunted. But SHE has never seen anything worse-looking than herself in it. a",thumbnail:b,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2020-05-15",publisher:b,subtitle:"Original Text"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377195324}}("L.
