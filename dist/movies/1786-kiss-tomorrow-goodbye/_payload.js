On the lam in a city where he knows nobody, Cotter has nothing to lose, no conscience to hold him back, and no limit to his twisted ambition. But in the midst of a criminal spree, a grift leads him to the boudoir of wealthy heiress Margaret Dobson, a woman with the power to peel back the rotten layers of his psyche and reveal the damaged soul beneath. Vicious and thrilling, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a look at one man’s relentless attack on American society, conjuring one of the most memorable antiheros of twentieth-century noir fiction. This ebook features an extended biography of Horace McCoy.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YGCZP1xAatMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2012-04-17","Open Road Media","They Shoot Horses, Don't They ; Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye ; No Pockets in a Shroud ; I Should Have Stayed Home","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=x_jyAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1983-01-01"))
