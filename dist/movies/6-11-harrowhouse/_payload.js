Phillip Springer has been grading diamonds since he was eight years old. His eyes are as sharp as any magnifying glass, and he has used them to turn the family diamond business into a global concern. Besides their love of diamonds, the Springers have another interest: the occult, ESP, and the mystical power of gems. Phillip has never fully believed in such superstition, but a sudden death in his family forces him to contemplate things he thought impossible. Among Phillip’s inheritance is Stone 588, a flawed diamond that the family was never able to sell but that his sister claims has the power to heal—and the power to save Phillip’s dying son. But before the boy can be cured, the stone is stolen. To save his child, Phillip must recover the rock, and he will kill to get it back.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KhZhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:b}},{id:1745,attributes:{title:"Green Ice",description:"In New York Times–bestselling author Gerald A.

In the mountains of Colombia, even an amateur can make a mint digging for emeralds, but an all-powerful syndicate, the Concession, controls the gems. Wiley and his new partner, heiress Lillian Holbrook, play a dangerous, double-crossing game with the Concession and its watchdogs because, for different reasons, they’re both willing to risk everything for the brilliant green stones.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=uxVhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531244065}}("movie","","Gerald A.
