YOUDUNIT! So you want to write a mystery. There's more to it than just a detective, a dead body, and Colonel Mustard in the drawing room with the candlestick. Fortunately, Larry Beinhart--Edgar Award-winning author of You Get What You Pay For, Foreign Exchange, and American Hero--has taken a break from writing smart, suspenseful thrillers to act as your guide through all the twists and turns of creating the twists and turns of a good mystery. Drawing on advice and examples from a host of the best names in mystery writing--from Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane to Scott Turow and Thomas Harris--plus some of his own prime plots, Larry Beinhart introduces you to your most indispensable partners in crime: *Character, plot, and procedure * The secrets to creating heroes, heroines, and villains (\"All writers draw upon themselves and their experience. While the whole of yourself might not be capable of being either a serial killer or an FBI agent, there are parts in each of us that are capable of almost anything.\") * The fine art of scripting the sex scene *The low-down on violence (\"A crime novel without violence is like smoking pot without inhaling, sex without orgasm, or a hug without a squeeze.\" ) *And much more! From the opening hook to the final denouement, Larry Beinhart takes the mystery out of being a mystery writer.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YUWHQ23bOB8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2010-12-01",publisher:"Ballantine Books",subtitle:b}},{id:11196,attributes:{title:"Foreign Exchange",description:"The IRS is on his tail, so Tony Cassella is on the run . . . Facing prison for tax violations, private detective Tony Cassella flees the IRS and heads for the Alps, where he becomes the owner of the only Laundromat in a chic Austrian ski town. A few weeks after his French lover gives birth to a baby girl, Cassella the laundry-magnate gets a job offer that could finally set things right back home. An American teen and a Japanese businessman have been killed in a freak avalanche, and the dead girl’s mother wants Cassella to find out why her daughter died. The Japanese man was carrying a disk whose contents are of great interest to the CIA, and returning it to Langley could mean the end of Cassella’s IRS headache. To find the disk, he must confront a global network of killers, thieves, and retired spies. Quickly in over his head, Cassella realizes that to survive in this world of international intrigue, he will have to do much more than wash, fold, and ski.

To avoid the hell of three years in prison, Wood turns witness for the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mysterious investigation rankles the top brass at Wood’s old firm. Desperate to learn what Wood’s telling the feds, the remaining partners hire Tony Cassella, a private investigator whose past includes a year or so at Yale University’s law school, a stint as a corrections officer, and a cocaine addiction. Though he’s recently gotten his life back on track, Cassella is drawn to trouble, and can imagine no greater thrill than tangling with the SEC. When Wood—under witness protection—is killed in a mugging, Cassella smells conspiracy. His hunt for the real crooks will leave no one safe, no matter how blue their blood.
