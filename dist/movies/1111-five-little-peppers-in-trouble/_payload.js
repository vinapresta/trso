But Jasper's Aunt Martha Wilcox still wants to go to court to get custody of him. Jasper knows nothing about this and would rather live with his grandfather and the Peppers. J.H. believes she has a case, considering that they all live in the Peppers' cramped cottage. So with Mrs. Pepper's approval, J.J. decides to spend Jasper and all five Pepper children to boarding school so Martha can't get a hold on Jasper, but they only tell Polly the reason. At this new school, the other children treat the Peppers like lepers just because of their poor background; Polly gets the worst treatment, as the other teenage girls try everything to get rid of her and her siblings, but Polly endures the mistreatment rather than risk losing Jasper to his aunt.",slug:"five-little-peppers-in-trouble"}}},books:{data:[{id:6302,attributes:{title:"Five Little Peppers and how They Grew",description:"The five little Peppers are an adorable family being raised by their widowed mother.
