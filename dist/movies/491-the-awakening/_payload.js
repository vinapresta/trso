Abraham \"Bram\" Stoker (1847 – 1912) was an Irish author most famous for his 1897 Gothic novel “Dracula”, a seminal book that continues to influence the vampire genre in print and film to this day. Many vintage books such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive. It is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially-commissioned new biography of the author.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HlEEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2020-10-16",publisher:"Read Books Ltd",subtitle:c}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703500865}}("Bram Stoker","movie","",null,"series",1,"The Jewel of Seven Stars","e-artnow"))
