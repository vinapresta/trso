As the trio battle their way through the treacherous jungle, what began as a professional rivalry soon turns into a personal rivalry as well, and the two men engage in a strange combat that can end only with the destruction of one of them.

Alan Caillou, still in the British army after serving in North Africa, found himself appointed its Police Commissioner. He became responsible for supervising law and order in a territory including a desert plain, mountains, two small towns, and a railroad line whose boundaries were defined as about 300 miles long and 20 feet wide. This book is the warm and amusing account of his two years there. With affection and understanding, Alan Caillou evokes the charm of this strange land, and its sometimes strange customs. Alan Caillou is an author with a thirst for adventure. During World War II he served with the British Intelligence Corps behind enemy lines in North Africa, was captured by the Italians, and escaped just before his scheduled execution. He then joined the guerillas to fight in Yugoslavia and Italy. After the war, he returned to Africa to become a safari guide. Mr. Caillou now makes his home in Arizona.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_1e2H3WxWBAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2000-01-01"))
