In dire financial straits, young couple Mike and Amy Lloyd—a former cab driver and a New York prep-school teacher, respectively—have signed away their independence to become live-in servants for one of the city’s wealthiest and most private families. At first, the Durie home, a cavernous Gilded Age palazzo off Fifth Avenue, is a maze of intimidation: sixteen other employees, eight Duries in residence, forbidden rooms, and an exact and unbreakable set of rules. For Amy, personal secretary to the aged and blind Miss Margaret, that includes never broaching the subject of her employer’s “condition” or the tragic accident that caused it. On the other hand, Mike, an aspiring writer, is already taking notes for a Durie-inspired novel. A modern gothic, he’s guessing—part Rebecca, part Psycho. Most of the plot, he’ll soon discover, won’t require much imagining. But Amy, bound to the servitude of the matriarch—a woman cut off from the world for fifty years—is growing more curious and unnerved by Miss Margaret’s demands: the sudden trips to the Plaza hotel, the mysterious bank transactions, and an extended invitation to a stranger for a private dinner. By the time Amy realizes the truth—that she and her husband have been enlisted as unwitting accomplices in a subtly played series of moves that could lead to something rather unspeakable—it could be too late.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=QTXWDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:f,published:"2017-03-07",publisher:j,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1694069562680}}("movie","","Stanley Ellin","series","House of Cards",null,1,"Hired as a tutor for a madwoman’s son, an American expatriate scraps to stay alive A washed-up heavyweight with dreams of becoming a writer, Reno Davis is down to his last franc when he lands a job as a bouncer at a sprawling Paris discotheque. His first night, he saves a slumming beauty from a pair of café toughs, and she rewards him with a well-paid job tutoring her darling son. But what she really wants is a bodyguard to keep her precious baby safe from terrors real and imagined. Reno’s new boss is a mental case, paranoid and delusional, whose lovers have a bad habit of dying violent deaths. But in this case, her paranoia may be justified. Protecting the boy draws Reno into an international conspiracy that stretches from Paris to Rome to the killing fields of northern Algeria. When the bullets start to fly, this ex-fighter begins to fear that he may be punching above his weight.","2014-07-08","Open Road Media"))
