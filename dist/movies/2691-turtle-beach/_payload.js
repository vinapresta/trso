Hawke remains one of the finest examples of political biography in Australian literature.Robert James Lee Hawke is one of the great men of Australian public life and his story makes compelling reading. Blanche d'Alpuget's sensitivity and psychological insight into Hawke's early years reveal how the son of devout Christian parents was reared to public duty and to the ambition of political leadership.Known throughout his life as a tireless campaigner for workers' rights and a man of wild personal habits, Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar, educated in three universities, before rejecting an academic career to commit himself to the trade union movement. As President of the ACTU from 1970 to 1980 he was a master negotiator and peacemaker in industrial life. He agitated for social and economic reforms, becoming a folk hero and the most popular Australian of his time. While he was President of the Australian Labor Party he sought to heal its wounds after the sacking of the Whitlam government; as the leader of Australia's unions he held back potentially violent industrial action over this most divisive issue. To unionists he was a giant killer; to some employers, a crypto-Communist bent upon their destruction. Hawke: The Early Years is an intimate portrait of a man of extraordinary achievements who struggles to overcome his drinking and philandering in order to rise to the highest office in Australia.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TWLMv526nywC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Blanche d’Alpuget"],firstBook:c,published:"2010-10-01",publisher:k,subtitle:"The Early Years"}},{id:1620,attributes:{title:"WHITE EYE: A NOVEL BY THE AUTHOR OF TURTLE BEACH",description:"Animal rights activist Diana Pembridge is embroiled in a tangle of scientific corruption and sexual scandal when her friend, scientist Carolyn Williams, is found murdered, and chief scientist John Parker will go to any lengths to protect his deadly secrets. 12,500 first printing.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=I1aqAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Blanche D'alpuget"],firstBook:c,published:"1993-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:1621,attributes:{title:j,description:"Based on exhaustive research and interviews, this record is a meticulous portrait of wily and brilliant Australian politician, Bob Hawke.

When a young female scientist is found murdered at the research facility, John encounters Diana Pembridge, an animal rights activist who suspects there is more to John's work than meets the eye. Diana has dedicated her life to caring for majestic birds of prey. When she discovers the body of her childhood friend near the research station, she immediately suspects murder. Her questioning leads her into a web of scientific corruption. But when people will go to deadly lengths to protect their secrets, getting too close to the truth threatens to lead to her own demise.
