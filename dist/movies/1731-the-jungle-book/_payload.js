He was born in India, where he spent the first six years of his childhood. The stories of his popular \"Jungle Books\" were written when Kipling lived in the United States. In 1907 Rudyard Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature - as the youngest recipient to date. Also he was the first English-language writer to receive the prize. ------ Kipling published his famous \"Jungle Book\" in 1894. It tells the well-known stories of Mowgli, a boy growing up in the jungle with animals and the laws of nature as his teachers. Furthermore the book contains stories of animal protagonists (for example the mongoose and snake-hunter Rikki-Tikki-Tavi), told as fables which use animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. It is also possible to interpret Kipling ́s main work as allegories of the politics and society of the time. The \"Jungle Book\" is still one of the most popular works in English literature. \"The Second Jungle Book\" was published in 1895, and contains more stories of Mowgli and also of other animal protagonists.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=dztLvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:"2018-11-08",publisher:"Independently Published",subtitle:b}},{id:8890,attributes:{title:"The Jungle Books",description:"The story of the man-cub Mowgli who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle, guided by his mentors Baloo the bear, Bagheera the black panther and the ancient python Kaa, and who confronts his arch-enemy Shere Khan the tiger, is one of the greatest literary myths ever created. Mowgli's adventures are juxtaposed with other animal stories set in the British Empire, ranging from the heroic battle of 'Rikki-tikki-tavi' and the Himalayan pastoral 'Purun Bhagat' to the drama of survival in 'The White Seal'. With The Jungle Books Rudyard Kipling drew on ancient beast fables, Buddhist philosophy and memories of his Anglo-Indian upbringing to create a rich, symbolic portrait of man and nature, and an eternal classic of childhood that has had a lasting impact on our imaginations.
