The Russians called the project TELEFON. Collect 430 first-class English speakers whoâd never left the country. Drill them in every detail of American life and then hand-pick the top students for drug-assisted hypnosis. Every one of them believes he is the American whose papers he carried, and every one of them has been programmed to destroy a target in the United States. The trigger is a coded phone message. It was a brilliant plan. But now, at the wrong time, it was being executed by the wrong man and the Russians must stop TELEFON by dispatching their own special agents to the United States. This âdoozy of a thriller,â which was made into a classic film starring Charles Bronson, is now available in eBook format for the first time (The New York Times).</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12191"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=WnDg-yMO3_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book 58 Minutes (Basis for the Film Die Hard 2)" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>58 Minutes (Basis for the Film Die Hard 2)</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Walter Wager<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Graymalkin Media</span><span><span> - </span>2/18/2013</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>After Die Hard blew the doors off movie theaters, there was no doubt that Bruce Willisâs one-man-army of a cop would hit the big screen again, even harder. And Die Hard 2 made it happenâdoubling down on the explosive action. And just like the original blockbuster, the sensational sequel leaped from the pages of a suspense masterâs pulse-pounding novel... A massive blizzard has shut down nearly every East Coast airport, stranding travelers on the ground and in the air. But those circling the skies above New Yorkâs Kennedy Airport have far more to worry about than missed connections. When the control towerâs radar suddenly goes dark, a mysterious caller known only as âNumber Oneâ announces that the countdown to terror has begun. Nineteen planes, and their helpless passengers, are now airborne hostagesâin the ruthless hands of a dangerous man on a deadly mission. And if the U.S. government doesnât bow to his demands, hell will rain from above as one jetliner after another exhausts its fuel... and plunges to earth. With only 58 minutes between life and death, there may be nothing anyone can do...except one New York City cop, with nerves of steel, attitude to burn, and a reputation for being hard on crimeâand even harder to kill.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12192"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=UovkBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Time of Reckoning" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Time of Reckoning</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Walter Wager<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Diversion Publishing Corp.</span><span><span> - </span>3/3/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>A breakneck thriller by the author of 58 Minutes, the basis of the blockbuster film Die Hard 2.

Later in the U.S. some seemingly ordinary people after receiving a phone call go out and destroy key American military installations. Back in the U.S.S.R. General Strelsky and Colonel Malchenko send for Grigori Borzov, a KGB agent who has been to the U.S. on missions before. They inform him that after the U-2 incident in fear of the possibility that a war with the U.S. will occur; they were part of an operation called TELEFON that involved recruiting young agents and then brainwashing them into believing that they are Americans. They would assume the identity of an American who died a long time ago and who would be their age now. They would be situated in a city that is near or where a key U.S. military installation is located. They were also programmed to destroy upon receiving the command phrase. They have been fortunate that they have never had to send them on their missions. But they believe that Dalchimsky stole the book that lists all the TELEFON agents and is now sending them out on their suicide missions. It also seems that the current KGB Chairman is unaware of TELEFON so Strelsky and Malchenko want Borzov to go to America and find Dalchimsky. Borzov, who is endowed with a photographic memory, memorizes the second TELEFON book and goes to America and is aided by Barbara.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">6.6/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>Â  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">47%</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Kelly&#39;s People, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
