Now that the dullish Henry Pulling has left his job with an agreeable pension and a firm handshake, he plans to spend more time weeding his dahlias. Then, for the first time in fifty years, he sees his aunt Augusta at his mother’s funeral.

Here the eminent author of The Power and the Glory, The Third Man, and The Heart of the Matter speaks of himself, his life, and his works. Though reluctant to be interviewed, especially by an academic or journalist he did not know, Greene was more at ease in an interview with a personal friend, who he felt would be less likely to misunderstand or misquote him. Yet even his good friend V. S. Pritchett spent considerable time trying to pin him down for his 1978 interview. When he finally did arrange an interview, Pritchett tells that Greene&#39;s &quot;flat conspiratorial, laughing voice . . ., of itself, makes him the best company I&#39;ve known in the last forty years&quot;. Other interviewers--included here are V. S. Naipaul and Penelope Gilliatt--shared Pritchett&#39;s opinion, but many found that he avoided idle conversation for fear that his words would be misconstrued. Greene&#39;s anxiety was not without foundation. In an interview with Michael Menshaw, Greene explained: &quot;It&#39;s got so I hate to say who I am or what I believe...A few years ago I told an interviewer I&#39;m a gnostic. The next day&#39;s newspaper announced that I had become an agnostic&quot;. After such incidents, Greene turned to the anecdote--relating an experience with Fidel Castro or with Papa Doc Duvalier--to communicate in interviews with strangers. Nevertheless, in all the interviews Greene granted over the years, the reader hears very clearly the voice of a man whose conversation is as painfully honest and unpretentious as is his written prose. The interviews here are divided chronologically into four periods, loosely related to his subject matter or to his reputation at the time of theinterview. Thus the reader sees the development of the writer from a callow but gifted young man into one of the foremost men of letters in the English-speaking world.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb12714"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=DqBaAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The Collected Edition: Travels with my Aunt" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The Collected Edition: Travels with my Aunt</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Graham Greene<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->1/1/1970</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p></p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFmODEwOTEtNDE1Yy00YjE1LWFmNGMtOTNkY2E2ZWNkYjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Travels with My Aunt" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Travels with My Aunt is based on the book Travels with My Aunt? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">At his mother&#39;s funeral, stuffy bank clerk Henry Pulling (Alec McCowen) meets his Aunt Augusta Bertram (Dame Maggie Smith), an elderly eccentric with more-than-shady dealings who pulls him along on a whirlwind adventure as she attempts to rescue an old lover.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">6.4/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">57%</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Travels with My Aunt, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
