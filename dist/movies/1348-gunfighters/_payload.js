He carries the body to the Banner ranch, the largest in the territory, and is accused by Banner of murdering Tyrell; Banner orders Deputy Sheriff Bill Yount, who is in Banner's pay, to arrest Kane. But Kane has the sympathy of Banner's daughter, Jane, who notifies Inskip of Kane's plight, and Inskip arrives in time to prevent a lynching. Sheriff Kiscade dismisses the murder charge for lack of evidence. Brazos then sets out to find the killer of his friend.

A convenient fall guy, Brazos is accused of the murder of Allen Neece, son of Abe Neece. The Neeces are the former owners of Twin Sombreros, but lost it to the Surface family when their $50,000 herd of cattle mysteriously disappeared, turning the once-proud Abe into a broken man as he and his twin daughters are kicked off their former land. Brazos barely manages to avoid a hanging, but when he falls for one of the Neece girls he decides he can’t just leave without finding out who really killed Allen and what’s at the bottom of this war over the ranch. As he starts to champion the Neece family, all hell breaks loose and Brazos comes across one violent encounter after another. Brazos becomes an instrument of vengeance, furiously shooting his way through the web of lies and greed that now hangs over Twin Sombreros Ranch. Zane Grey returns with another grand story of action and romance. First published in 1940, Twin Sombreros is a tale from the true master of the Western about a good man doing what he can to right a wrong. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction that takes place in the old West. Westerns—books about outlaws, sheriffs, chiefs and warriors, cowboys and Indians—are a genre in which we publish regularly. Our list includes international bestselling authors like Zane Gray and Louis L’Amour, and many more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=9y6CDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2015-09-22","Simon and Schuster","A Western Story",""))
