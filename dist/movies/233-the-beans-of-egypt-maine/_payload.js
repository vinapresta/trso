Mickey Gammon, fifteen, has dropped out of school and been kicked out of his home. But he has found a new place in the Settlement—a rural cooperative that deals in alternative energy, farm produce, and locally made goods. Run by “The Prophet,” the Settlement is demonized by the media as a compound of sin, but its true nature remains foreign to outsiders. It is here where Mickey meets another deserted child, six-year-old Jane, whose mother is in jail on trumped-up drug charges. Playing “secret agent,” Jane cunningly prowls the Settlement in her heart-shaped sunglasses, imagining that her plans to bring down the community will reunite her with her mother. As they struggle to adjust to their new, complex surrogate family, Mickey and Jane are about to witness mounting unrest within the Settlement’s ranks—which soon builds to a shocking and devastating crescendo. The School on Heart’s Content Road is “a profoundly human novel . . . Absolutely one of a kind” (USA Today), from an author who, “like Flannery O’Connor . . . has a gift for expressing the true spirit of a culture” (San Francisco Chronicle). “Chute can’t help but create characters who live and breathe.” —The Washington Post",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xd_NgIgAfQMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2009-07-08",publisher:f,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568367939}}("Carolyn Chute","","movie",null,"The Beans of Egypt, Maine","Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc.","series",1,"A novel of a down-and-out New England family that “seizes the reader on its opening page with . . . a knock-about country humor unmistakably its own” (Newsweek). There are families like the Beans all over America. They live on the wrong side of town in mobile homes strung with Christmas lights all year round. The women are often pregnant, the men drunk and just out of jail, and the children too numerous to count. In this novel that “pulses with kinetic energy,” we meet the God-fearing Earlene Pomerleau, and experience her obsession with the whole swarming Bean tribe (Newsweek). There is cousin Rubie, a boozer and a brawler; tall Aunt Roberta, the earth mother surrounded by countless clinging babies; and Beal, sensitive, often gentle, but doomed by the violence within him. In The Beans of Egypt, Maine, Carolyn Chute—whose jobs included waitress, chicken factory worker, and hospital floor scrubber before gaining renown as a prize-winning novelist—creates “a fictional world so vivid and compelling that one feels at a loss when it ends. The Beans belong with the Snopes clan of Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County, with Erskine Caldwell’s white Southerners, and with the rural blacks of Alice Walker’s The Color Purple” (San Jose Mercury News).","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=A8uWUA7RCosC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2008-09-09"))
