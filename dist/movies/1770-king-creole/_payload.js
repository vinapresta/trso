Born in a desert sandstorm that takes his mother's life, he is raised as an Arab, unaware of his true Israeli identity. But his life-and his fate-are controlled by two women: the woman he once loved who cannot seem to recapture his heart, and the woman searching for the father who left her many years ago. As he becomes increasingly entangled in the political web that surrounds his businesses, he must decide who he can trust-and finds both enemies and allies in the unlikeliest places. The powerhouse storytelling of Harold Robbins shines through in The Pirate, a commanding tale of luxury and decadence, greed and passion, high finance and international intrigue against a backdrop of Mideast oil and global terrorism.

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive. As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption -- each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future -- will help steer his rocky course. Gritty, compelling, and groundbreaking for its time, A Stone for Danny Fisher is a tale of ambition, hope, and violence set in a distinct and dangerous period of American history. A classic, sexy bestseller by Harold Robbins, reintroduced to a whole new generation of readers.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Dv8G_TqENicC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2007-08-07","Simon and Schuster"))
