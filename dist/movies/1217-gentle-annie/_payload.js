His face turned into black stone. \"Sixty-seven.\" To Western cattle barons in 1899 the encroaching homesteaders were like cinders eyes. But they were legal. Even the rustlers among them seldom were brought to justice for lack of evidence. There seemed to be only one way to pry loose those on the land, and discourage others from settling: scare them off. To do just that some of the ranchers met in Pearl City in secret conclave. They agreed to hire the most notorious professional killer then known—Bus Crow. They figured that a small dose of Bus Crow would quickly clear the ranges, and keep them clear. WICKED WATER is the story of the bloody descent of Bus Crow on the homesteaders of Pearl County. It is the story, too, of the woman who loved him in spite of herself, who bowed to justice in spite of her love. Against a background of driving action, MacKinlay Kantor probes the mysteries of a killer's mind, of the dark rebellion that made him cry: I'll always kill. I’ll shoot them down ... get a gun and keep killing and killing.

C. & W. passenger train that Sep­tember day. One of them was Rich Wil­liams, with grimy stubble on his cheeks; the brakeman shoved him off the blind baggage, and Rich strolled up the empty street to Kite's Cafe and Cookson's Bar. He looked like an ordinary bum, but he carried a gun that people couldn't see; and he had a lot of money and papers strapped inside his shirt. The other passenger was a girl with high-piled hair and an Irish mouth. She descended timidly from the day coach; men looked at her ankles. Annie Lingen thought she knew where she would be spending the night, but there was a sur­prise in store for her. A hundred other surprises await the readers of Gentle Annie. The blustering Tatums with their angry eyes; Lucian Barrow, the ragged photographer who specializes in pictures of dead outlaws; and, above all, the Goss family—the brothers Cot and Vi, and their strange, wild mother. This frontier novel roars like an Okla­homa tornado. The punctuation is made with bullet-holes; a pageant of love and terror and reckless encounter springs from every page.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ATtxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1942-01-01","1951-01-01"))
