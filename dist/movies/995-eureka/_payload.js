Twenty years later, in 1945, he lives in luxury on a Caribbean island that he owns. But his wealth brings him no peace of mind as he copes with Helen (Jane Lapotaire), his bored, alcoholic wife; Tracy (Theresa Russell), his dear, but headstrong, daughter who has married a dissolute, philandering social-climber; and Miami mobsters who want his island to build a casino. His life is entangled with the obsessions of those around him with greed, power, and debauchery against a background of occult symbolism.",slug:"eureka"}}},books:{data:[{id:855,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:e,authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:f,publisher:g,subtitle:a}},{id:856,attributes:{title:h,description:a,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:857,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:e,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:f,publisher:g,subtitle:a}},{id:858,attributes:{title:h,description:a,thumbnail:i,authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:j,publisher:k,subtitle:a}},{id:859,attributes:{title:"From Evidence to Proof",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Y8c_AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"1956-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Searching Analysis of Methods to Establish Fact"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940963163}}("","Marshall Houts",null,"Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=s8UuAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1976-01-01","London : R.
