Archie doesn't even know Petulia's name, but only knows her as the woman who brought in a young Mexican boy into the hospital with serious injuries. Petulia's pursuit of Archie is relentless - she even declaring that they will someday be married - even as Archie dates another woman named May. Archie eventually learns part of the reason why Petulia is so determined to cheat on David as her relationship to David and David's wealthy father are brought to light.

Kip Maltz's fiancee, fat Bernie Nathan, comes down with an incurable attack of the hiccups; Rabbi Goldman's mood is \"seesawing rapidly from manic to depressive\" because he's secretly infatuated with Kip; cousin Alvin is almost killed while trying to fix the organ which breaks down and Kip herself is carefully underplaying anything that might arouse ardor in her intended. This whips through the previous private lives of the participants -- sordid, sorry and occasionally funny moments as it wavers back and forth among the proceedings -- Kip tries an unsuccessful last minute fling with the parking lot attendant; Rabbi Goldman proposes -- but the inevitable knot is tied and in a last minute upbeat, husband and wife discover that they might like each other.\"--Kirkus.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=_1-Tj0VZU-AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:h,publisher:a,subtitle:g}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309566974}}("","movie","John Haase",null,"series",1,"A Novel","1969-01-01"))
