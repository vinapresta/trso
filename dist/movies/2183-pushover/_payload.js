Ritchie McCallister is the young clean honest one, who feels compelled to look after his partner Paddy Ahern. Ahern is an average cop, who has a habit of taking a nip from the bottle at times. Walter Sheridan is the third detective. He's a wise-ass, who only looks out for himself. The stakeout is the apartment of a bank robbers wife. One night the robber returns, and Sheridan and Ahern nab him. The guy has the money with him, so Sheridan kills him, making it look like self defense. He's really after the cash, and he convinces Ahern he's doing this to protect him. Sheridan throws the body along with the loot into the trunk, with plans to retrieve it after the night is over. Things go quickly wrong for Sheridan and after a failed attempt to silence a female witness, he ends up killing Ahern. The second half of the novel involves the manhunt for Sheridan.

Following the opening of the Erie Canal and the boom of the thriving salt industry, Syracuse became a bustling metropolis and a jumping-off point for pioneers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers. The first constable, H.W. Durnford, soon faced the problem of roustabouts, gamblers, and robbers preying upon the canal and warehouse workers along lower James Street. While the community experimented with village and night watches, special constables, and patrolmen, no permanent solution was found. On January 1, 1846, the final die was cast when Syracusans clashed with salt boilers from the adjoining village of Salina in the bloody Coffeehouse Riot. Because of insufficient police services, the militia had to put down the riot. To improve services, both villages voted to consolidate, and in 1848, the City of Syracuse and its police department were created. Syracuse Police illustrates the evolution of urban policing and gives insight into the department's core values and the police officers who have held them sacred.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=W1gBbDXFm34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Daniel F.

They need to maintain a continuous watch on an apartment in a new housing development to catch a bank robber named Wheeler when he returns to his wife. They set up 12-hour shifts, and to relieve the boredom, McCallister begins to watch the young nurse in the next apartment. But it's only when Ahern leaves his post for a few drinks down the street that Wheeler returns. Sheridan spots him on the street, and he and Ahern brace the guy by his car. That's when everything starts to go wrong. Because Wheeler is carrying the cash, and Ahern is a little tight, and that is just more temptation than Sheridan can resist... THE DARK WINDOW Ray Cassidy has recovered from the police shootout that put him in the hospital, but the psychological scars still linger. He takes a job as security officer at the ritzy Hotel Imperial, but he's still gun-shy. When he spots Janisek and his stooge Emil in the corridors, his cop instincts kick in-he knows something is amiss here. But when he confronts Emil, Cassidy freezes up, and Emil is accidentally killed. What he doesn't know is that Janisek is here to work a switch with Bishop Hruba, recently escaped from an Iron Curtain prison, in order to steal the bishop's donations. Now it becomes a cat and mouse game between Janisek and Cassidy in Park Avenue's finest.
