The bolts of energy radiating from the apical dome were visible as far away as New Haven, Connecticut. This was the first and last time anyone would witness such a display. Three years later, broke and unable to secure further funding, Tesla abandoned the Wardenclyffe tower and his dream of worldwide wireless power. He returned to Manhattan where he promptly suffered a nervous breakdown. So say the history books. But new evidence has surfaced that a shadowy fraternal order stepped in and provided generous funding after J. P. Morgan reneged. Witnesses state that testing of the tower continued but only on foggy days when the discharges would not be noticed. The final test took place on April 18, 1906. Around dawn, in heavy fog, the tower was charged to maximum capacity; across the Atlantic, in Abereiddy, Wales, two copper prongs attached to a 50-watt lightbulb were thrust into the ground. The bulb lit. Tesla had proved that worldwide wireless power was possible. Why then, at the moment of his greatest vindication, did Nikola Tesla abandon his project? What could possibly have transpired at Wardenclyffe that day to so rattle him that he would deny the world his transformative technology? We may never know.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Yop-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:b,published:"2018-12-14",publisher:"JournalStone",subtitle:d}},{id:8959,attributes:{title:a,description:"Members of the Nazi super-race discover a mysterious and terrible force that is far more deadly than their own power in an eerie old fortress in Transylvania",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=YI4rAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Francis Paul Wilson"],firstBook:b,published:"1981-01-01",publisher:"William Morrow & Company",subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940961508}}("The Keep",null,"F.
