There's nothing worse than peaking in high school. Nobody knows that better than Josie Pie. She was kind of a big deal—she dropped out of high school to be a star! But the bigger you are, the harder you fall. And Josie fell. Hard. Ouch. Broadway dream: dead. Meanwhile, her life keeps imploding. Best friend: distant. Boyfriend: busy. Mom: not playing with a full deck? Desperate to escape, Josie gets into reading. Literally. She reads a book and suddenly she's inside it. And with each book, she’s a different character: a post-apocalyptic heroine, the lead in a YA rom-com, a 17th century wench in a corset. It’s alarming. But also . . . kind of amazing? It’s the perfect way to live out her fantasies. Book after book, Josie the failed star finds a new way to shine. But the longer she stays in a story, the harder it becomes to escape. Will Josie find a story so good that she just stays forever?",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=08HNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:"2020-08-25",publisher:"Roaring Brook Press",subtitle:d}},{id:3744,attributes:{title:l,description:"New York Times bestselling author Shannon Hale offers up mystery, romance, and a lot of fun in this modern homage to Jane Austen.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=Vt7f5QLKAdMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:g,publisher:c,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568393501}}("Shannon Hale","movie","A&C Black","",null,"Austenland","2013-01-01","series",1,"The funny, charming novel for Jane Austen fans, from New York Times-bestselling author Shannon Hale.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=fTXOJ3BClGwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","Midnight in Austenland"))
