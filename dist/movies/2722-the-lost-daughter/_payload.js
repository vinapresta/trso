Instead, slightly embarrassed by the sensation, she feels liberated, as if her life has become lighter, easier. She decides to take a holiday by the sea, in a small coastal town in Greece. But after a few days of calm and quiet, things take a menacing turn. Leda encounters a family whose brash presence proves unsettling, at times even threatening. When a small, seemingly meaningless event occurs, Leda is overwhelmed by memories of the difficult, unconventional choices she made as a mother and their consequences for herself and her family.

Beginning in the 1950s in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples, Elena Ferrante’s four-volume story spans almost sixty years, as its main characters, the fiery and unforgettable Lila and the bookish narrator, Elena, become women, wives, mothers, and leaders, all the while maintaining a complex and at times conflicted friendship. This first novel in the series follows Lila and Elena from their fateful meeting as ten-year-olds through their school years and adolescence. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between two women. “An intoxicatingly furious portrait of enmeshed friends.” —Entertainment Weekly “Spectacular.” —Maureen Corrigan, NPR’s Fresh Air “Captivating.” —The New Yorker",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hVDVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2020-03-03",publisher:e,subtitle:a}},{id:12969,attributes:{title:i,description:"A New York Times BestsellerLonglisted for the 2016 MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZENamed TIME Magazine's #1 Book in it's \"10 Best Fiction Books of 2015\" listNamed one of the \"10 Best Fiction Books of 2015\" by The New York Times Book ReviewNamed one of the \"10 Best Fiction Books of 2015\" by People MagazineFeatured in the Wall Street Journal's list of \"15 Books to Read This Fall\"Included as one of \"30 blockbuster novels to look out for this fall\" by Entertainment WeeklyListed as one of Publisher Weekly's \"Most Anticipated Books of Fall 2015\"Included in the Kirkus list of \"21 Must-read Fall books\"Featured as one of the New York Times Book Review's \"100 Notable Books of 2015\"The Neapolitan Novels (Book 4)Here is the conclusion of the dazzling saga of two friends, the brilliant, bookish Elena and the fiery, uncontainable Lila.
