British pulp novelist James Hadley Chase's bestseller that exploded into the world's headlines! The original controversial classic, fully unabridged and unexpurgated. No Orchids For Miss Blandish is a 1939 crime novel by the British writer James Hadley Chase. The novel was influenced by the American crime writer James M. Cain and the stories in the pulp magazine Black Mask. No Orchids for Miss Blandish provoked considerable controversy because of its explicit depiction of sexuality and violence. The novel was a great critical success and was included in the Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. In 1942, the novel was adapted into a stage play which ran for over 200 performances at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. In 1948, it was adapted into a British film No Orchids for Miss Blandish. The 1971 American film The Grissom Gang was also based on the novel. It was also the subject of a fairly well-known essay by George Orwell, Raffles and Miss Blandish, and parodied by Raymond Queneau in We Always Treat Women Too Well. The 1939 novel was extensively rewritten and rearranged by the author in 1962 because he thought the world of 1939 too distant for a new generation of readers.",thumbnail:b,authors:["James Chase"],firstBook:true,published:"2013-04-03",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:7248,attributes:{title:e,description:"No Orchids for Miss Blandish James Hadley Chase A Shocking Tale of Vile, Ruthless Gangsterism -- The Toughest Novel You'll Ever Read!

Both are set in Ireland, were initially published by Éditions du Scorpion under the pseudonym Sally Mara, and then later published together by Gallimard as Les Œuvres completes de Sally Mara (1962). The book examines Queneau’s life when he wrote these texts, the pervasive Joycean influences, his surreal version of the 1916 Dublin Uprising versus the real event, his remarkably accurate Dublin city and his use of the Irish language. The seven core chapters are explorations of prominent aspects of these works, and most involve the solution of puzzles by means of investigations of contexts, contemporary events, and a wide variety of sources. In conclusion, the book makes a convincing case for the literary and entertainment value of Les Œuvres completes de Sally Mara as a long-planned and subtly integrated work.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=EjqvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["James Patrick Gosling"],firstBook:d,published:"2019-09-12",publisher:"Cambridge Scholars Publishing",subtitle:"Bewildered by Excess of Love"}},{id:7251,attributes:{title:"The Hidden Cinema",description:"How does film censorship work in Britain?

Robertson charts the role of the British Board of Film Censors, established in 1913, and the histories of a variety of noteworthy films including Battleship Potemkin and No Orchids for Miss Blandish and revealing how censorship continues to exert a marked influence on many important films - like the controversial A Clockwork Orange - some of which have now vanished from British screens altogether.
