But now, just shy of fifty, he is no longer considered the boy wonder of business. He’s unemployable. He and his wife, Maggie, have been forced to move out of their suite in Manhattan’s Waldorf Tower and they have yet to pay this semester’s tuition for their seventeen-year-old son’s private school. Then Lincoln is thrown a lifeline. Coastal Foods, a struggling cannery in New Jersey, needs a top executive to help get the company back on its feet. For the first time, Lincoln feels a part of something bigger than himself.
