Structured around the story of two families -the Desnoyers and the Hartrott- that, although partially coming from a common trunk, each belong to one of the sides in conflict, the novel runs agilely through the Dantean scenarios of a broken Europe, on whose desolate battlefields the great vitalist who was Blasco finally makes the desire to live beat wild and invincible.In this edition the second of the 3 parts of this wonderful book of prophecies.Biography of Vicente Blasco IbáñezVicente Blasco Ibáñez (1867-1928) was a Spanish novelist, politician, and journalist who lived between the second half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th. The making of him literary took place between his native Valencia, Paris and Argentina, where he founded two colonies: Cervantes and Nueva Valencia. In his role as a journalist he wrote texts in both Spanish and Catalan. During his youth he founded the newspaper El Pueblo, in Valencia.
