He identifies himself mostly as a barber, Hendersons' Barbers in a working class neighborhood of Glasgow, Scotland, where he's worked for twenty years. More introspective than extroverted, which does not work well for the business, he has fewer and fewer customers, and as such his current boss, Wullie Henderson (Stephen McCole), son of the retired owner James Henderson (James Cosmo), who originally hired him, is moving him further and further away from the spotlight of the shop. Meanwhile, five men so far have been killed by who the general public is nicknaming the \"Body Parts Killer,\" as the murderer sends through the post body parts of the victims to the victims' loved ones. Lead investigator, Detective Inspector Holdall (Ray Winstone), assisted by Detective Inspector Callum MacPherson (Kevin Guthrie), is no closer now to discovering the Body Parts Killer's identity than when the murders started two months ago. Wanting results, Chief Superintendent McManaman (Sir Tom Courtenay) takes Holdall and MacPherson off the case, instead assigning it to Detective Inspector June Robertson (Ashley Jensen), an A-type personality who believes she can do no wrong, and will take credit for others doing right, which places her and Holdall at odds with each other. What were so far these two unrelated paths start to merge when Wullie tells Barney that he is giving his chair to a new barber, effectively firing him. In an ensuing altercation of sorts, Barney accidentally kills Wullie. When Wullie is reported as missing, Holdall and MacPherson are sent to investigate, and increasingly believe that Barney not only killed Wullie, whose body has not been discovered, but that he is the Body Parts Killer, both which Robertson believes are nonsense. The matter gets more complicated when Barney's self-absorbed, chain smoking and dispassionate mother, Cemolina (Dame Emma Thompson), gets involved, she who would never be considered Mother of the Year.",slug:"barney-thomson"}}},books:{data:[{id:2626,attributes:{title:i,description:j,thumbnail:k,authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:e,publisher:f,subtitle:l}},{id:2627,attributes:{title:"The Long Midnight of Barney Thomson",description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2003-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:2628,attributes:{title:"The Long Midnight of Barney Thomson (Barney Thomson Book 1)",description:"Described by the Scotsman as 'gleefully macabre, hugely enjoyable black burlesque', THE LONG MIDNIGHT OF BARNEY THOMSON was published to great critical acclaim, has spawned a successful series, has been translated into several European languages and was filmed as THE LEGEND OF BARNEY THOMSON, directed by and starring Robert Carlyle, and featuring Emma Thompson and Ray Winstone.Barney Thomson, awkward, diffident, Glasgow barber, lives a life of desperate mediocrity; shunned at work and at home, unable to break out of a twenty year rut, each dull day blends seamlessly into the next.

MPs are being murdered in revenge attacks for the expenses scandal, and Westminster is in a state of turmoil. With the government on the verge of collapse, the last Labour Prime Minister — desperately clinging to power — decides there is only one way to reclaim the government's authority. Relying on dubious intelligence, he instructs the Army to make plans to launch an invasion of the eastern seaboard of the United States of America. As humanity stands on the brink of war, it may well be that we have reached the End of Days. The world of men is at a crossroads: will it be annihilated, or will it survive and be allowed to evolve naturally into a beer-drinking sloth species with no appendages? Ultimately, when the blood stops flowing and the last money-grabbing MP has been stabbed in the head, the fate of us all and of Planet Earth itself will rest in the hands of one man: renegade barbershop legend, Barney Thomson.
