This omnibus edition combines Neil Simon’s two memoirs, Rewrites and The Play Goes On, into one volume that spans his extraordinary five-decade career in theater, television, and film. Rewrites takes Simon through his first love, his first play, and his first brush with failure. There is the humor of growing up in Washington Heights (the inspiration for his play Brighton Beach Memoirs) where, despite his parents’ rocky marriage and many separations, he learned to see the funny side of family drama, as when his mother thought she saw a body on the floor in their apartment—and it turned out to be the clothes his father discarded in the hallway after a night of carousing. He describes his marriage to his beloved wife, Joan, and writes lucidly about the pain of losing her to cancer. The Play Goes On adds to his life’s story, as he wins the Pulitzer Prize and reflects with humor and insight on his tumultuous life and meteoric career. “Neil Simon’s terrific memoirs are worth revisiting” (New York Post). Now, with the whole story in one place, he traces the history of modern entertainment over the last fifty years as seen through the eyes of a man who started life the son of a garment salesman and became the greatest—and most successful—American playwright of all time.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=eUPjCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:true,published:"2016-11-08",publisher:f,subtitle:b}},{id:639,attributes:{title:e,description:"Visitors from New York, Philadelphia, London, and Chicago are the protagonists in four playlets set in the Beverly Hills Hotel",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lCZaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1977-01-01",publisher:"Random House Incorporated",subtitle:"A New Comedy"}},{id:640,attributes:{title:"The Collected Plays of Neil Simon",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=2KgTIHaRA6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"1971-01-01",publisher:f,subtitle:b}},{id:641,attributes:{title:"The Play Goes On",description:"A revealing and heartfelt memoir of a Pulitzer Prize–winning artist finding joy and inspiration after tragedy. In his critically acclaimed Rewrites, Neil Simon talked about his beginnings—his early years of working in television, his first real love, his first play, his first brush with failure, and, most moving of all, his first great loss. Simon's same willingness to open his heart to the reader permeates The Play Goes On. This second act takes the reader from the mid-1970s to the present, a period in which Simon wrote some of his most popular and critically acclaimed plays, including the Brighton Beach trilogy and Lost in Yonkers, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Simon experienced enormous professional success during this time, but in his personal life he struggled to find that same sense of happiness and satisfaction. After the death of his first wife, he and his two young daughters left New York for Hollywood. There he remarried, and when that foundered he remarried again. Told with his characteristic humor and unflinching sense of irony, The Play Goes On is rich with stories of how Simon's art came to imitate his life. Simon's forty-plus plays make up a body of work that is a long-running memoir in its own right, yet here, in a deeper and more personal book than his first volume, Simon offers a revealing look at an artist in crisis but still able and willing to laugh at himself.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=z6suclolIq4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2011-12-13",publisher:f,subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:642,attributes:{title:e,description:b,thumbnail:b,authors:["Robert Grossbach",a],firstBook:d,published:"1979-01-01",publisher:"Black Lace",subtitle:"A Novelization"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377242560}}("Neil Simon","","movie",null,"California Suite","Simon and Schuster","series",1))
