In 1927, in Brooklyn, New York, Carl Brown and Annie McGairy meet and fall in love. Though only eighteen, Annie travels alone halfway across the country to the Midwestern university where Carl is studying law—and there they marry. But Carl and Annie’s first year together is much more difficult than they anticipated as they find themselves in a faraway place with little money and few friends. With hardship and poverty weighing heavily upon them, they come to realize that their greatest sources of strength, loyalty, and love, will help them make it through.

First published in 1948, and long out of print, Tomorrow Will Be Better is a heartwarming story of love and marriage from Betty Smith, the beloved author of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Set in the Williamsburg and Bushwick sections of Brooklyn in the 1920s, Tomorrow Will Be Better is the story of Margy Shannon--shy, eager, joyfully optimistic--and her search for something better from life than the hard misery of poverty in which she lives. All Margy's parents have ever known is an unrewarding life of poverty, pain, and hard work--a life that has ultimately worn them down. But Margy, young and just out of school, still holds steadfast to an unshakable hopefulness and believes a better life is possible. Her goals are simple enough--to find a husband she loves, have children, and live in a nice home--one where her children will never know the terror of want, the need to hide from quarreling parents, and the dread of unjust punishment. And when she meets Frankie Malone, she thinks at last her dreams might be fulfilled. Rich with the flavor of its Brooklyn background, and the joys and heartbreak of family life, Tomorrow Will Be Better is told with a simplicity, tenderness, and humor that only Betty Smith could write.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ujpbyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:e,publisher:"Harper Perennial",subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940962851}}("","Betty Smith","Joy in the Morning",null,"2020-05-05","1965-01-01"))
