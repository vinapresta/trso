A writer's den, as dusty and gloomy as the cell of a medieval monk. Two people sit opposite each other, one of them talking, the other typing. But why, in such already sombre surroundings, does one of them wear thick dark glasses? And what, above all, has caused an unearthy shadow to fall across these two interwoven destinies?Apart from the several startling twists of its own brilliant plot, A Closed Book springs a few extra surprises on those readers who have already seen the film version. 'A page-turner par excellence.' Evening Standard'Gilbert Adair's spookily gripping novel blends an Agatha Christie-like twist with a Hitchcockian plot.' Marie Claire'This short, intellectually resourceful thriller...sparklingly clever, adroit and entertaining.' The Spectator'Gilbert Adair's novel has an almost cinematic, even radio-play, sense of suspense, but plays tricks only possible on the page...The finale is deliciously apt and unsettling.' Independent'Very readable indeed...a darkly entertaining soufflé...A Closed Book positively invites an informed second reading.'

When he wanders into the wrong theater and finds himself watching the wretched teen-pic Hotpants College II, cerebral British author Giles De’Ath becomes romantically obsessed with dreamboat Ronnie Bostock. Giles’s infatuation drives him to the unthinkable: he reads American fan magazines and watches movies with titles like Tex Mex and Skid Marks. And finally, he travels to Long Island, intent on meeting Ronnie in the flesh. The basis for the hit independent film starring Jason Priestley and John Hurt, Love and Death on Long Island is a brilliant and heartrending update of Thomas Mann’s early twentieth-century novella Death in Venice. It offers both a poignant meditation on passion, and “a very funny portrait of an extraordinarily unworldly academic’s introduction to the dizzyingly incomprehensible realm of popular culture” (Nick Hornby). “Brief, pure, intense . . . The writing is masterly, the conjuring of contrasting worlds a triumph.” —The Financial Times",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=nYa7gK7hwEcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:c,published:"2007-12-01",publisher:"Open Road + Grove\u002FAtlantic",subtitle:"A Novel"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940959810}}("","Gilbert Adair",null,"The Holy Innocents","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HxxAAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","1989-01-01","Dutton Adult","A Romance"))
