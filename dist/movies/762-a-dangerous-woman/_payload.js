Aubrey Wallace is the kind of man no one notices. Dotty Johnson is the kind of woman no one can ignore. One afternoon, they both disappear from the small Vermont town where they live. The next day, two hundred miles away, a toddler is kidnapped from her Massachusetts home. For the next five years, Aubrey, Dotty, and the kidnapped child—united by a mix of strange love, desperate need, and the crime that brought them together—are trapped in a nomadic existence governed by their constant fear of discovery. Canny, the little girl, becomes Aubrey’s entire existence. But Dotty wants out. She is tired of being saddled with this fearful man, and when she meets a brutal ex-convict, the wheels of Canny’s return to her natural parents are wrenched fatally into motion.

It is the summer of 1960 in Atkinson, Vermont. With no help from her alcoholic ex-husband, Marie Fermoyle is raising three children on the edge of poverty. Her seventeen-year-old daughter, Alice, is becoming emotionally involved with a local priest in a staunchly Catholic town that disapproves of Marie’s divorce. Alice’s brother Norm is a hotheaded sixteen-year-old, and twelve-year-old Benjy is isolated and full of anxieties, looking with yearning at the Klubocks next door, who seem to live an orderly, peaceful life much unlike his own family’s. Now, Marie has met a new man: Omar Duvall, who talks about opportunities and riches but so far seems only to sponge off the Fermoyles. A lonely, desperate single mother like Marie is easy prey for con men, but she resists the temptation to doubt him. Young Benjy, though, may eventually reveal a disturbing secret that could shatter all her hopes. A portrait of a family as well as a town and its secrets, Songs in Ordinary Time is “a gritty, beautifully crafted novel rich in wisdom and suspense” (The Miami Herald). An Oprah’s Book Club selection from an author nominated for the National Book Award and the PEN\u002FFaulkner Award, it is “extraordinary . . . a deeply satisfying story” (USA Today).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iUM7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:f,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:e}},{id:4885,attributes:{title:b,description:g,thumbnail:h,authors:[a],firstBook:f,published:c,publisher:d,subtitle:e}},{id:4886,attributes:{title:b,description:"Martha Horgan is different.

Named one of the five best novels of the year by Time magazine, A Dangerous Woman is the story of the damaged and emotionally unstable Martha Horgan, an outcast in her small Vermont town. She stares; she has violent crushes on people; and, perhaps most unsettling of all, she cannot stop telling the truth. After a traumatic experience during her teenage years, the thirty-two-year-old now craves love and companionship, but her relentless honesty makes her painfully vulnerable to those around her: Frances, her wealthy aunt and begrudging guardian; Birdy Dusser, who befriends her and then cruelly rejects her; and Colin Mackey, the seductive man who preys on her desires. Confused and bitter, distrusting even those with her best interests at heart, Martha is slowly propelled into a desperate attempt to gain control over her own life. The National Book Award–nominated author of Songs in Ordinary Time tells a tale of unnerving suspense and terrifying psychological insight that is “at once thrilling and deeply affecting” (The New York Times).","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=h0M7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",""))
