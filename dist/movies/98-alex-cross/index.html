C. criminal at his own game. Washington, DC, has never been more dangerous. After shots pierce the tranquil nighttime calm of Rock Creek Park, a man is dead: what looks at first like road rage might be something much more sinister. But Alex has only just begun asking questions when he&#39;s called across town to investigate a new murder, one that hits close to home: his former boss and the beloved mentor of Alex&#39;s wife, Bree. Now there&#39;s a killer on the loose, a long list of possible suspects, a city in panic, and nobody in charge of the besieged police force. . . until Bree gets tapped for the job. As Bree scrambles to find her footing and close two high-profile cases, new violence stuns the capital. What should be a time for her to rely on Alex for support and cooperation is instead a moment of crisis in their marriage as well as their city when their investigative instincts clash and their relationship reaches a breaking point. And the fiendish mind behind all the violence has appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner, with a terrifying master plan he&#39;s only begun to put in motion. To beat him at his own game, Alex and Bree must take the law back into their own hands before he puts them both out of commission . . . permanently.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb458"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZSQwzQEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book Criss Cross" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>Criss Cross</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->James Patterson<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><!----><span><!---->9/29/2020</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>When a mysterious serial killer known as &quot;M&quot; launches a deranged &quot;investigation&quot;, Alex Cross and his partner must unearth long-forgotten secrets to survive -- or risk getting buried themselves. In a Virginia penitentiary, Alex Cross and his partner, John Sampson, witness the execution of a killer they helped convict. Hours later, they are called to the scene of a copycat crime. A note signed &quot;M&quot; rests on the corpse. &quot;You messed up big time, Dr. Cross.&quot; Was an innocent man just put to death? Alex soon realizes he may have much to answer for, as &quot;M&quot; lures the detective out of the capital to the sites of multiple homicides, all marked with distressingly familiar details -- details that conjure up decades-old cases. Details that conjure up Cross family secrets. Details that make clear that M is after a prize so dear that -- were the killer to attain it -- Alex&#39;s heart would no longer have reason to beat.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb459"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qx0lDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book The People vs. Alex Cross" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>The People vs. Alex Cross</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->James Patterson<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Hachette UK</span><span><span> - </span>11/20/2017</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>With explosive charges and shocking evidence, Alex Cross is about to face the trial of the century in the #1 New York Times bestselling series. Alex Cross is on the wrong side of the law. Charged with gunning down followers of his nemesis Gary Soneji in cold blood, he is being turned into the poster child for trigger-happy cops. Cross knows it was self-defense. But will a jury see it that way? When his former partner Sampson shows up needing his help, Cross jumps at the chance, even if it may end up costing him what&#39;s left of his career. When a string of young, blonde women go missing, the investigation leads Cross and Sampson to the most depraved, darkest corners of the internet, where murder is just another form of entertainment. As the prosecution presents its case, and the nation watches, even those closest to Cross begin to doubt his innocence. If he can&#39;t convince his own family that he didn&#39;t pull the trigger with intent to kill, how can he hope to persuade a jury? But even with everything on the line, Cross will do whatever it takes to stop a dangerous criminal . . . even if he can&#39;t save himself. Struggling to prove his own innocence and uncover the truth lurking online, Cross must risk everything to save his most at-risk patient of all: himself.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MDE0NjUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQzNjg5Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Alex Cross" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Alex Cross is based on the book Deadly Cross? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Dr. Alex Cross is on his last police duty to track down an assassin called Picasso, who&#39;s been torturing and killing rich businessmen in Detroit.
