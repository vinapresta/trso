One of them, Baxter, dies of a heart attack midway back to the States, and is buried at sea. Once they dock, the other man, Keefer, is fished out of the bay three days later after having been pistol-whipped to death. He had been seen flashing a lot of money around the night before. But as far as Rogers knew, Keefer was broke. Now the cops want to know where the money came from. They don't believe that Baxter really died at sea. Neither do the goons who pick up Rogers one night to beat the truth out of him. But if Baxter wasn't who he seemed to be, one thing Rogers knows for sure is that he's definitely dead-but who the hell was he? ALL THE WAY: Marian Forsyth made Harris Chapman the prosperous man he is today. As his private secretary, she advised him on his acquisitions, and turned him into a very wealthy man. She assumed she would become his second wife. But Harris made a foolish mistake: he fell in love with a younger, prettier woman. And now Harris must pay. And to that end, Marian creates a brilliant and detailed plan to steal $175,000 from him. All she needs is someone who sounds enough like Harris that he can become Harris long enough to pull it off. That's where Jerry Forbes comes in-footloose, morally flexible, and completely obsessed with Marian. It's the perfect match.... for the perfect crime.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=fJeOzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2021-08-23",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:1842,attributes:{title:c,description:"Charles Williams' two cycles of poems, Taliessin through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, have been described as the major imaginative work about the Grail of the 20th century, praised for their spiritual reality and complex patterns of sound and haunting rhythms. In this new edition David Llewellyn Dodds collects together Williams' earlier poems on Arthurian themes, which both grew into and gave way to the final versions. This collection, which Charles Williams called The Advent of Galahad, was never published as such, though individual poems did appear in print. There are also later fragments, designed to form a sequel to The Region of the Summer Stars, which appear for the first time.
