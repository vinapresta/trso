Despite the doctors believing he to be rehabilitated in not suffering from the fantasies which dominated his life, Dennis is still required to check in with his case officer, Morton Azenauer, once a week. Azenauer will do whatever he can to help Dennis survive in the outside world. A year following his release, Dennis violates the conditions of his release by moving without telling Azenauer, thus missing his weekly check-ins. He moves to Winslow, Massachusetts where he has gotten a job at Sausenfeld Chemical Co., his boss, Bud Munsch, the company, and his acquaintances in town not aware of his history. In not being truly rehabilitated, Dennis believes the company is part of an alien conspiracy to poison the water supply, including openly discharging chemical waste into the local lake next to the plant. Dennis spends much of his time gathering photographic evidence to support his belief. He also becomes infatuated with seventeen year old high school senior Sue Ann Stepanek upon first sight. In his \"investigative\" work, Dennis is able to convince Sue Ann that he is a secret agent, she who he co-opts into those investigations as they begin a romantic relationship. However, as Sue Ann deals with what she considers her repressed life, she, in her own slightly off kilter mental state and using her relationship with Dennis, works toward her own agenda, leading to tragic consequences.",slug:"pretty-poison"}}},books:{data:[{id:10591,attributes:{title:"She Let Him Continue",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=vE-TAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:true,published:"1966-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10592,attributes:{title:"Gad",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=4k6TAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:c,published:"1979-01-01",publisher:"HarperCollins Publishers",subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:10593,attributes:{title:"Joop's Dance",description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=o0-TAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:c,published:"1969-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:10594,attributes:{title:"A Little Piece of Me",description:"Marcia Kleinman has a difficult husband, a difficult mother and a little boy, Max, who has a rare chronic liver disease that will eventually require a liver transplantation. A talented pianist, Marcia resisted strong urgings from her teachers and, especially, from her mother to develop a concert career and, instead, has been content to teach music at the college level. Marcia's mother was a well known concert pianist. Marcia's husband, Michael, is a young, aggressive attorney at a major, multicity firm who was transferred to the Los Angeles office from New York. When Max, their son, becomes ill they are presented with difficult choices that include allowing Marcia to donate a portion of her own liver. Michael is initially opposed to this choice and would prefer to wait until an appropriate liver becomes available from another child of Max's approximate age and size who has suddenly died. During the months during which Max's condition slowly worsens Marcia seeks relief from stress by deciding to learn Beethoven's Appassionata piano sonata, a piece that her mother recorded but that Marcia had not been able to master in the past. When she was a teenager Marcia visited southern California and came to love it. When Michael is offered a promotion and partnership in the law firm, if he returns to the New York office, their marriage is further stressed by Michael's resistance to Marcia being a donor, by his controlling nature, and by Marcia's reluctance to leave Los Angeles and her close friends.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=T5LCAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Stephen A.
