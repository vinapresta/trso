Raised in separate worlds, these brothers are bound by a bitter rivalry for riches and power, but mostly, for the exciting, wildly captivating woman they fight all their lives to possess, a woman whose passion for one destroys her love for the other.

Dempsey, 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Required reading for West Point and Marine Corps cadets, Once An Eagle is the story of one special man, a soldier named Sam Damon, and his adversary over a lifetime, fellow officer Courtney Massengale. Damon is a professional who puts duty, honor, and the men he commands above self-interest. Massengale, however, brilliantly advances by making the right connections behind the lines and in Washington's corridors of power. Beginning in the French countryside during the Great War, the conflict between these adversaries solidifies in the isolated garrison life marking peacetime, intensifies in the deadly Pacific jungles of World War II, and reaches its treacherous conclusion in the last major battleground of the Cold War—Vietnam. Now reissued with a new foreword by acclaimed historian Carlo D'Este, here is an unforgettable story of a man who embodies the best in our nation—and in us all.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=d5GHcz4d-NQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"2013-03-12",publisher:h,subtitle:b}},{id:1137,attributes:{title:i,description:"The conflict in outlook and strategy between Massengale, a commissioned officer, and Damon, who has risen through the ranks, is traced throughout the two world wars",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=pRUrmwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1997-01-01",publisher:"U S Army War College Foundation Press",subtitle:b}},{id:1138,attributes:{title:"The Violent Shore",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=o6dAAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1962-01-01",publisher:b,subtitle:b}},{id:1139,attributes:{title:g,description:"Two brothers, Tip and Chapin Ames, take different paths on the way to financial success and engage in a fierce rivalry over the elusive and beautiful Josefina Gaspa",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=19uyksdXq40C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:e,published:"1983-02-01",publisher:"Avon Books",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531357886}}("movie","","Anton Myrer","series",null,1,"A Green Desire","Harper Collins","Once an Eagle"))
