In order to add to his already-vast wealth, he regularly sends raiders north of the border to burn, plunder, and kill. But when De Gorios’s marauders swoop down on John Killane’s property, set it ablaze, and murder Killane’s brother, the taciturn Texan vows revenge. Aided by his fellow ranchers, Killane slips into Mexico and prepares an assault on De Gorios’s hacienda. Violence leaves a bitter taste in his mouth, and the motives of his backers may not be as transparent as they first appeared, but Killane has made a promise that he would rather die than break. If he cannot summon the courage and the coldness to act, he might just get his wish.

But when a fight erupts at a schoolhouse dance, Lohman is forced to defend himself, and a young rancher named Shorty Boyd winds up dead. The Boyds are numerous, powerful, and vicious, and they want revenge. With no one else to turn to, Lohman sets out across canyon country to reunite with his ailing father in New Mexico Territory. The journey will be long, hot, and perilous, and to survive it, this mild-mannered boy must become the cold-blooded killer he never wanted to be. Based on real events, The Hell Bent Kid is a tale of pursuit as stark and mesmerizing as the Southwestern landscape in which it is set. Unrelenting from first page to last, it ranks alongside The Ox-Bow Incident, True Grit, and The Searchers as one of the most unique and artful stories of the West ever told. In 1958 it was adapted into the film From Hell to Texas, directed by the famed Henry Hathaway and starring Don Murray, Diane Varsi, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=lSFwCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
