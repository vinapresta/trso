But that doesn't mean he forgets his clients. Andy has always been convinced that Joey Desimone, a man convicted of murder nine years ago, was innocent and believes that Joey's family's connections to organized crime played a pivotal role in his conviction. While there isn't much Andy can do for him while he serves out his prison sentence, Joey suggests that he check up on Joey's elderly uncle. He'd rather not, but as a favor to Joey, Andy agrees to take his dog, Tara, on a few visits. The old man's memory is going, but when Andy tries to explain why he's there, it jogs something in the man's mind, and his comments leave Andy wondering if Uncle Nick is confused, or if he just might hold the key to Joey's freedom after all this time. Andy grabs on to this thread of possibility and follows it into a world where the oath of silence is stronger than blood ties, and where people will do anything to make sure their secrets are kept. Riveting, suspenseful, and highly entertaining, Leader of the Pack is bestseller David Rosenfelt's latest entry in his much-beloved Andy Carpenter series.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=4eua_uJTqd4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Rosenfelt"],firstBook:d,published:"2012-07-17",publisher:"Minotaur Books",subtitle:"An Andy Carpenter Mystery"}},{id:10008,attributes:{title:"Leadership by Example",description:"An accessible and inspiring guide to good leadership based on a popular lecture that Dr. Chopra has presented to thousands Very few of us are leaders all the time, in everything we do, but all of us can become a leader in specific situations. In a committee, in business, at a social club or at a religious institution, we all find a time in our lives when we can lead. Few people set out knowingly to become leaders, rather they see a need and they find a way of dealing with it, and often others choose to follow their example. Based on a talk that he has given to more than 60,000 people in at least seven countries, the \"LEADERSHIP\" mnemonic that Dr. C hopra explains is as follows: L - listen well. E - empathy. A - attitude. D - dreams and decisiveness. E - effectiveness. R - resilience. S - a sense of purpose. H - humility and humor. I - integrity and imagination. P - principles, and willingness to pack other people's parachutes.
