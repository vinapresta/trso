A thousand miles back East, his comrades are locked in battle with the Confederates, but out here he is alone... His desolate posting will bring him into contact with the lords of the southern plains - the Comanche. He has no knowledge of their customs but Dunbar is intrigued by these people and begins a transformation from which emerges a different man... a man called Dances With Wolves. In The Holy Road, it is now 1874 and times are hard for the Plains Indians. The white man is closing in from all directions, claiming land, driving the tribes on to reservations.
