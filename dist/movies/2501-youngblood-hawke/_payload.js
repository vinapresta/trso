Sarah, however, may be more astute in the matters of business than her son. In his spare time, Arthur is writing a novel under the pen name Youngblood Hawke, it, his first, which he is able to sell to a New York publishing house. As such, Arthur moves to New York City while he works on the necessary rewrites and contemplates his next novel, which he knows can and will pour out of him. Even before that first novel, Alms of Oblivion, is published, Arthur is the toast of certain literary circles in New York. Naive to the ways of the business, he gets caught up in this new life, in having to deal with the publishers, agents, managers, lawyers, critics, theater people who want him to translate the work into a play, and movie types who want to purchase the movie rights. He has to decide whose advice to follow in these matters, he potentially being overextended in he wanting to do and have it all. He does not realize until he is ensconced within this life that there was a latent passion associated with his work, the women around him who can smell it ooze off of him. The feminine advances for who he ultimately falls is that of Frieda Winter, a wealthy, married socialite and a frequent patron of the arts. In his affair with Frieda which needs to be hidden at every turn, Arthur may not yet realize that what he feels for his story editor, Jeanne Green, who initially discovered his unsolicited manuscript, is more than just professional gratitude. Through it all, Arthur may eventually come to the understanding that his standing in this world is solely judged on the success or failure of his latest work.",slug:"youngblood-hawke"}}},books:{data:[{id:12035,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=RYZzwrVt5yQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"1982-05-02",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12036,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Herman Wouk (romancier).)"],firstBook:d,published:"1963-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12037,attributes:{title:"Youngblood Hawke, Etc",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Herman WOUK"],firstBook:d,published:"1964-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:12038,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Arthur Wouk",e],firstBook:d,published:"1962-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"A Novel"}},{id:12039,attributes:{title:"Sailor and Fiddler",description:"\"In an unprecedented literary accomplishment, Herman Wouk, one of America's most beloved and enduring authors, reflects on his life and times from the remarkable vantage point of 100 years old. Many years ago, the great British philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin urged Herman Wouk to write his autobiography. Wouk responded, \"Why me? I'm nobody.\" Berlin answered, \"No, no. You've traveled. You've known many people. You have interesting ideas. It would do a lot of good.\" Now, in the same year he has celebrated his hundredth birthday, Herman Wouk finally reflects on the life experiences that inspired his most beloved novels. Among those experiences are his days writing for comedian Fred Allen's radio show, one of the most popular shows in the history of the medium; enlisting in the US Navy during World War II; falling in love with Betty Sarah Brown, the woman who would become his wife (and literary agent) for sixty-six years; writing his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Caine Mutiny; as well as a big hit Broadway play The Caine Mutiny Court Martial; and the surprising inspirations and people behind such masterpieces as The Winds of War, War and Remembrance, Marjorie Morningstar, and Youngblood Hawke. Written with the wisdom of a man who has lived through two centuries and the wit of someone who began his career as professional comedy writer, the first part of Wouk's memoir (\"Sailor\") refers to his Navy experience and writing career, the second (\"Fiddler\") to what he's learned from living a life of faith. Ultimately, Sailor and Fiddler is an unprecedented reflection from a vantage point few people have lived to experience\"--",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=7rY9DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:d,published:"2016-10-18",publisher:"Simon and Schuster",subtitle:"Reflections of a 100-Year-Old Author"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309595561}}("","movie","Youngblood Hawke",null,"Herman Wouk","series",1))
