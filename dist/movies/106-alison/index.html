Alice &#39;S Adventure In WonderlandAlice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre.Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.2. Through The Looking Glass Through the Looking-Glass Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a novel by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the sequel to Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Set some six months later than the earlier book, Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. Through the Looking-Glass includes such celebrated verses as &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;, and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The mirror which inspired Carroll remains displayed in Charlton Kings.3. The Hunting Of The Snark The Hunting of the Snark is a fantastical &quot;nonsense&quot; poem, exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of tradesmen who set off to find the eponymous creature. The fanciful eight-canto poem describes the sea voyage of a bellman, boots (bootblack), bonnet maker, barrister, broker, billiard marker, banker, beaver, baker, and butcher, and their search for the elusive, undefined snark. While scholars have attributed to the work hidden meanings from political subversion to existential agony, Carroll maintained that it was intended simply as nonsense. 4.&#39;Alice&#39;s Adventures Underground Lewis Carroll wrote Alice&#39;s Adventures Underground for the young Alice Liddell, from which arose the more familiar version of Alice in Wonderland. In this book the entire manuscript has been photographed in colour and reproduced with precise fidelity to the original.5.
