Forsaken by the local townspeople, advised by Sheriff Wingate (Dale Wilson) to leave town, Lillian decides instead to take a stand against her sociopathic stalker, and enlists the help of an ex-logger Lester (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and his laconic young sidekick Nate (Alexander Ludwig), the only two men in town brave enough, or crazy enough, to go with her, and go up against Blackway.",slug:"blackway"}}},books:{data:[{id:3158,attributes:{title:h,description:"A young woman recently relocated to a tiny Vermont logging town, Lillian is menaced by a mysterious stalker named Blackway.

Things are not as they should be, however, in the sheriff’s small, protected domain. The outside world draws near, and threats multiply: the arrival in the district of a band of exotic, major league criminals; an ambitious and aggressive deputy; the self-destructive exploits of a local bad boy; Wing’s discovery of a domestic crisis. The sheriff’s response to these diverse challenges calls on all the personal resources he has cultivated during his working life: patience, tact, and (especially) humor.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=yuiz4vhyGVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:c,published:"2009-03-03",publisher:e,subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681703480703}}("movie","A Novel",null,"Castle Freeman, Jr.","Steerforth","series",1,"Go with Me","Castle Freeman","Go With Me","The Vermont hill country is the stark, vivid setting for this gripping and entertaining story of bold determination. The local villain, Blackway, is making life hellish for Lillian, a young woman from parts elsewhere. Her boyfriend has fled the state in fear, and local law enforcement can do nothing to protect her. She resolves, however, to stand her ground, and to fight back. A pair of unlikely allies – Lester, a crafty old-timer, and Nate, a powerful but naive youth – join her cause, understanding that there is no point in taking up the challenge unless you’re willing to “go through.” In this modern-day drama, a kind of Greek chorus – wry, witty, digressive; obsessively, amusingly reminiscent; skeptical, opinionated, and not always entirely sober – enriches the telling of this unforgettable tale as the reader follows the threesome’s progress on their dangerous, suspenseful quest.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=kygIprvy2i4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2008-04-15"))
