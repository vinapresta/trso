Jerry loves Lake Michigan and swimming its waters; he loves the beach and the live dune where he plays. But mostly, Jerry loves women. This isn’t the awkward lust of an adolescent; Jerry is a boy who loves women and everything about them: a flower tucked into the hair, or the length of a leg. Teenage Jerry is a charmer, a flirt, “an erotic pantheist or a pantheistic eroticist.” Always, in his honesty and quirkiness, he is an irresistible and lovable character, himself. When he falls for Rosalind, his love takes on new, humorous, and wondrous dimensions. At the Shores celebrates love in all of its forms; it is a coming-of-age novel for all generations.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ge0NAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:f,published:g,publisher:h,subtitle:i}},{id:10749,attributes:{title:"Jerry Engels",description:"The raucously sweet sequel to At the Shores Jerry Engels is in his junior year at Penn State. He lives with his fraternity brothers, flunks his classes, lifts weights, and thinks about women—constantly. Insatiable, Jerry devours the Kinsey Report in full, and sets out to test its findings wherever possible, grilling his brothers on their homosexual experiences, getting crabs from a prostitute, posing in the nude for art classes, and romancing a good friend’s little sister. Yet Jerry is not a rake but a carnal saint, delighting in life in a careless, grateful manner.

William and his girlfriend, Jane, are sensible University of Chicago graduates, happy lovers, children of good families—and self-described anarchists. When William accidentally runs over an elderly woman and is charged with manslaughter, their lives veer unexpectedly off path. As the consequences of William’s accident compound, the two find themselves butting up against the society they seek to drop out of.
