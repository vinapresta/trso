Sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, he became obsessed with one goal: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken. Charrière's astonishing autobiography, Papillon, was first published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape.

Condamné en 1933 au bagne, pour un meurtre qu'il n'a pas commis, Henri Charrière, dit \"Papillon\", en réchappera treize années et quelques tentatives d'évasion plus tard. Entre ces deux dates, l'\"enfer vert\"! Des années de réclusion totale aux îles guyannaises du Salut, des cavales en pleine jungle colombienne entrecoupées d'un intermède paradisiaque chez les Indiens Guajiros. Une épopée sur terre et sur mer qui s'achève par l'ultime évasion, la plus risquée, la plus désespérée, à bord d'un simple radeau, pour une traversée de l'océan impossible. Et pourtant, au bout, c'est la liberté ! On sort secoué, épaté de ce livre comme d'un superbe roman d'aventures.
