Jim Harrison’s critically acclaimed novella “Legends of the Fall”—which was made into the film of the same name—is an epic tale of three brothers fighting for justice in a world gone mad. Moving from the expansive landscape of early twentieth-century Montana to the blood-drenched battlefields of World War I Europe, Harrison explores the desperate actions of which men are capable when their lives or aspirations are threatened. Also including the novellas “Revenge” and “The Man Who Gave Up His Name,” Legends of the Fall confirms Jim Harrison’s reputation as a writer who “stands high among the writers of his generation. This book is rich, alive, and shatteringly visceral. A triumph” (New Yorker). “I can’t begin to do justice to the nuances of character and honest complexities of plot in this work. The writing is precise and careful—and sings withal.” —Raymond Carver, Washington Post Book World",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TbhkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:c,published:"2013-12-20",publisher:e,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1682568402611}}("Jim Harrison","movie",null,"","Grove\u002FAtlantic, Inc.","series",1,"Farmer","A quiet triumph . . . Joseph is a man suffocated by everything he loves most in the world: the land and its ghosts, love and friendship, integrity. Yes, it is the old story again. Taking it and making it new, as Harrison has done, is a miracle on the order of the loaves and fishes. But then so are all good novels.” The Washington Post The New York Times bestselling author of thirty-nine books of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry including Legends of the Fall, Dalva, and Returning to Earth Jim Harrison was one of our most beloved and acclaimed writers, adored by both readers and critics. In Farmer, he tells the story of Joseph, a forty-three-year-old farmer-schoolteacher who suddenly finds himself at a crossroads. Forced to choose between two lovers one a tantalizing young student, the other his beautiful childhood friend he must also decide whether or not to stay on the farm or finally seek the wider, more worldly horizons he has avoided all his life. Farmer is a wondrous blend of insight, storytelling, and the author’s uncanny ability to evoke the mysteries and beauties of the natural world.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=oJUfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2016-05-03","Open Road + Grove\u002FAtlantic","The Farmer's Daughter","The celebrated author of Legends of the Fall delivers “three novellas as dark as they are exuberant” and linked by the lyrics of Patsy Cline (Publishers Weekly, starred review). The three stories in The Farmer’s Daughter are as different as they are unforgettable. Written in the voice of a home-schooled fifteen-year-old girl in rural Montana, the title novella introduces an extraordinary character who must draw on her untapped strength and resilience when she encounters unexpected brutality. In another, Harrison’s beloved recurring character Brown Dog, still looking for love, escapes from Canada back to the States on the tour bus of an Indian rock band called Thunderskins. And finally, a retired werewolf, misdiagnosed with a rare blood disorder brought on by the bite of a Mexican hummingbird, attempts to lead a normal life but is nevertheless plagued by hazy, feverish episodes of epic lust, physical appetite, athletic exertions, and outbursts of violence under the full moon. The Farmer’s Daughter is a memorable portrait of three decidedly unconventional American lives. With wit, poignancy, and an unbounded love for his characters, “Harrison shows he is still at the top of his game with these compressed gems. Taken together, they present another fine accomplishment in a storied career” (Publishers Weekly, starred review). “Readers with a fondness for Hemingway’s Michigan stories or Cormac McCarthy’s spare regional novels will also find these tales much to their liking. Highly recommended.” —Donna Bettencourt, Library Journal (starred review)","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ILDSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2010-09-07","Novellas"))
