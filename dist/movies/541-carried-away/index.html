Jim Harrison’s critically acclaimed novella “Legends of the Fall”—which was made into the film of the same name—is an epic tale of three brothers fighting for justice in a world gone mad. Moving from the expansive landscape of early twentieth-century Montana to the blood-drenched battlefields of World War I Europe, Harrison explores the desperate actions of which men are capable when their lives or aspirations are threatened. Also including the novellas “Revenge” and “The Man Who Gave Up His Name,” Legends of the Fall confirms Jim Harrison’s reputation as a writer who “stands high among the writers of his generation. This book is rich, alive, and shatteringly visceral. A triumph” (New Yorker). “I can’t begin to do justice to the nuances of character and honest complexities of plot in this work. The writing is precise and careful—and sings withal.” —Raymond Carver, Washington Post Book World</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE1YWNhN2ItOTc4Mi00NmMzLThlOWQtMTAzYTFjZmE2NmVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0Nzk5NTQ2._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Carried Away" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Carried Away is based on the book Farmer? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Joseph Svenden is a middle-aged school-teacher who lives on a farm with his dying mother.
