As the Church called upon Franciscans to be bishops, professors, and inquisitors, their style of life began to change. Some in the order lamented this change and insisted on observing the strict poverty practiced by Francis himself. Others were more open to compromise. Over time, this division evolved into a genuine rift, as those who argued for strict poverty were marginalized within the order. In this book, David Burr offers the first comprehensive history of the so-called Spiritual Franciscans a protest movement within the Franciscan order. Burr shows that the movement existed more or less as a loyal opposition in the late thirteenth century, but by 1318 Pope John XXII and leaders of the order and combined to force it beyond the boundaries of legitimacy. At that point the loyal opposition turned into a heretical movement and recalcitrant friars were sent to the stake.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HKw3QDsgz30C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Burr"],firstBook:b,published:"2010-11-01",publisher:"Penn State Press",subtitle:"From Protest to Persecution in the Century After Saint Francis"}},{id:6556,attributes:{title:"The Trials of Frances Howard",description:"David Lindley re-examines the murder trials of Frances Howard and the historical representations of her as `wife, a witch, a murderess and a whore', challenging the assumptions that have constructed her as a model of female villainy.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ySCAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["David Lindley"],firstBook:b,published:"2013-08-21",publisher:"Routledge",subtitle:"Fact and Fiction at the Court of King James"}},{id:6557,attributes:{title:d,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:b,published:"1949-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Screenplay"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940973907}}("",null,"David Stern","Francis"))
