One day, however, White Fang is discovered by a local Native American man who brings him back to live in the Indian camp. White Fang has no true place in the wild or in the camp, and in order to be happy, must find out how to balance the brutality bred into him with obedience and respect. White Fang is a powerful adventure novel that explores redemption, morality, and the strength of the bond between animal and man. It is considered to be a companion piece to Jack London’s best-known novel, The Call of the Wild, and has been adapted for the screen numerous times—most notably into a 1991 feature film starring Ethan Hawke.

To survive Buck must listen to the Call and learn the ways of his wolf-ancestors, who guide him from within. \"White Fang\" tells the story of a half-wolf, half-dog nearly destroyed by the vicious cruelty of men. Brought to the very brink of his existence, White Fang is lucky enough to experience the one thing that can save him-- human love. Adventurer and activist, philosopher and alcoholic, Jack London was a man of great contradictions and greater talent. Both of these novels are written in a simple, direct, and powerful style that decades of readers have admired and that writers have imitated.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=cAAXGxGGzxkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1996-01-01",publisher:"Wordsworth Editions Limited",subtitle:b}},{id:11561,attributes:{title:"The Call of the Wild, White Fang and Other Stories",description:"The biting cold and the aching silence of the far North become an unforgettable backdrop for Jack London's vivid, rousing, superbly realistic wilderness adventure stories featuring the author's unique knowledge of the Yukon and the behavior of humans and animals facing nature at its cruelest.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ElVODGvDz70C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"1995-01-26",publisher:"Penguin UK",subtitle:b}},{id:11562,attributes:{title:"The Call of the Wild & White Fang",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=jn8FMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[d],firstBook:e,published:"2017-09-26",publisher:"Collector's Library",subtitle:b}},{id:11563,attributes:{title:"WHITE FANG",description:b,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=q3MtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["JACK LONDON"],firstBook:e,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:"PURE SNOW PUBLISHING",subtitle:"UNABRIDGED ORIGINAL CLASSIC"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1688531277942}}("movie","","series","Jack London",null,1,"White Fang"))
