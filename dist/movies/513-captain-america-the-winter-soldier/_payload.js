Joe Simon co-created Captain America, and was the first editor in chief of Marvel Comics (where he hired Stan Lee for his first job in comics). Simon began his prolific career in the Great Depression, and this book recounts his journey to New York City, his first comic book work, his meeting with Jack Kirby, and the role comics played in wartime America. He remembers the near-death of the comics, and the scramble to survive.

While the shadow of involvement in World War II casts a pall of fear over a frightened United States, Captain America and his teenage sidekick, Bucky, fight for freedom at home and abroad. The stories collected in this volume continue Captain America's classic WWII adventures, featuring villains and scenarios which embodied the fears and anxieties of an America moving toward entrance into the war. Whether confronting colorful super-villains like the Black Toad, the White Death and his arch-nemesis the Red Skull, or matching wits with foreign agents and saboteurs, Cap and Bucky swashbuckle their way through some of the most creative adventures of the '30s comics world. In fact, these adventures were for years held up to incoming Marvel artists and writers as examples of OHow to Do It Right. O These stories, along with those contained in Volume I of this series, also compete the full run of Captain America Comics collaborated upon by the characters' creators, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Painstakingly restored and recolored, these classic stories would cost thousands of dollars to collect in their original form.

This historical retrospective of Steve Rogers' various uniforms and super-hero mantles is a showcase of America's ever-evolving sociopolitical landscape. From his early days fighting in overt patriotic garb as Captain America during World War II through his adoption of the predominately black uniform and title of the Captain at a time when he became a symbol of resisting absolute government control, Rogers has always worn his allegiance openly. Time and again, Steve has returned to Captain America's red-white-and-blue iconography, proving that the symbolic clothing of the Sentinel of Liberty stands for a higher ideal than any one person or government can achieve.
