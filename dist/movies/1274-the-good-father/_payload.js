In 1781, John Adams observed that the American Revolution was its \"transcript.\" Known for its many protagonists—King Philip II, the Duke of Alba, the counts of Egmont and Hornes, radical Calvinists, obstreperous townspeople, and William of Orange—the Dutch Revolt brought into relief conflicts among civic freedoms, religious dissent, representative institutions, and royal authority. Drawing on a vast array of sources-including archival documents, political and religious pamphlets, ballads, chronicles and letters, and a rich store of popular prints-Peter Arnade gives us a new history of the core years of the revolt between 1566 and 1585, showing how the act of rebellion forged a political identity through ritual, symbol, and public action. In Beggars, Iconoclasts, and Civic Patriots, Arnade focuses on the political culture that took shape during the Revolt, a culture that itself fueled decades of turmoil. He sees the pulse of the Revolt in its public dramatization-the acts, words, and cultural representations that were its \"daily bread and popular voice.\" The violent wave of radical iconoclasm that swept the southern Netherlands in 1566 is the book's pivot, setting the stage for the Duke of Alba's brutal effort to restore the authority of the Spanish crown. Arnade details the sieges and violent sacks of Dutch cities by the Army of Flanders, and the response of Dutch rebels, who touted defiant cities as the seats and guarantors of unassailable rights and freedoms. This civic patriotism hailed William of Orange as father of the fatherland, his apotheosis hearkening back to late medieval princely ritual even as it invoked new republican imagery.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WlhuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Peter Arnade"],firstBook:true,published:"2018-09-05",publisher:"Cornell University Press",subtitle:"The Political Culture of the Dutch Revolt"}},{id:7002,attributes:{title:f,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:["Peter Prince"],firstBook:d,published:"1983-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:7003,attributes:{title:"American Prince",description:"“All my life I had one dream and that was to be in the movies.” He was the Golden Boy of the Golden Age. A prince of the silver screen. Dashing and debonair, Tony Curtis arrived on the scene in a blaze of bright lights and celluloid. His good looks, smooth charm, and natural talent earned him fame, women, and adulation—Elvis copied his look and the Beatles put him on their Sgt. Pepper album cover. But the Hollywood life of his dreams brought both invincible highs and debilitating lows. Now, in his captivating, no-holds-barred autobiography, Tony Curtis shares the agony and ecstasy of a private life in the public eye. No simple tell-all, American Prince chronicles Hollywood during its heyday. Curtis revisits his immense body of work—including the unforgettable classics Houdini, Spartacus, and Some Like It Hot—and regales readers with stories of his associations with Frank Sinatra, Laurence Olivier, director Billy Wilder, and film industry heavyweight Lew Wasserman, as well as paramours Natalie Wood and Marilyn Monroe, among others. As forthright as he is enthralling, Tony Curtis offers intimate glimpses into his succession of failed marriages (and the one that has endured), his destructive drug addiction, and his passion as a painter. Written with humor and grace, American Prince is a testament to the power of living the life of one’s dreams.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=x0sFjFxhoGIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Tony Curtis","Peter Golenbock"],firstBook:d,published:"2008-10-14",publisher:"Crown Archetype",subtitle:"A Memoir"}},{id:7004,attributes:{title:"The Prince and the Prosecutor: The Mark Twain Mysteries #3",description:"Working with the great Mark Twain is a job Wentworth Cabot relishes -- especially when it includes a first-class boat trip, a visit to Europe, and a steady paycheck.

A German prince, a pretentious Italian art critic, and a rich young lout from Philadelphia are nuisances to Cabot -- but for Twain they only figure as ready targets for his wit.
