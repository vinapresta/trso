At two-thirty in the morning of June 6, 1998, Whitley Streiber was awakened by somebody knocking on his hotel room door. A man came in, and everything he said was life-altering. This is the unsettling and ultimately enlightening narrative of what happened that night. Strieber was never really sure who this strange and knowing visitor was--a \"Master of Wisdom\"? A figure from a different realm of consciousness? A preternaturally intelligent being? He called him the Master of the Key. The one thing of which Strieber was certain is that both the man and the encounter were real. The main concern of the Master of the Key is to save each of us from self-imprisonment. \"Mankind is trapped,\" the stranger tells Strieber. \"I want to help you spring the trap.\" In a sweeping exchange between Strieber and the stranger--which takes the form of a classical student- teacher dialogue in pursuit of inner understanding--the unknown man presents a lesson in human potential, esoteric psychology, and man's fate. He illuminates why man has been caught in a cycle of repeat violence and self-destruction--and the slender, but very real, possibility for release. In its breadth and intimacy, The Key is on par with contemporary metaphysical traditions, such as A Course in Miracles, or even with the dialogues of modern wisdom teachers, such as D.T. Suzuki and Carl Jung.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ejyQGhZ7qNAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2011-05-12",publisher:"Penguin",subtitle:"A True Encounter"}},{id:11793,attributes:{title:"Alien Hunter",description:"Soon to be an original series on Syfy, from executive producers Gale Anne Hurd (The Walking Dead) and Natalie Chaidez (12 Monkeys) and Universal Cable Productions. Premieres April 2016. In Whitley Strieber's Alien Hunter, a young wife disappears in the night, never to be seen again. There is no evidence of kidnapping-in fact, everything indicates that she left on purpose. Her husband, a brilliant police detective, cannot believe this-but he also can't find her. Flynn Carroll's lost love becomes his obsession. He begins amassing a file of similar cases nationwide. His conclusion is unavoidable: somebody is taking people and making it look like they walked out on their own. As Flynn's case files grow, his work comes to the attention of Special Agent Diana Glass, a member of the most secret police unit on the planet. This police force seeks the most brilliant and lethal criminals who have ever walked free-thieves and murderers from another world. Without fully understanding what Glass and her team are doing, Flynn steps into a hidden world of extraordinary challenge and lethal danger. The job is the most difficult police assignment ever known to man, but the idea is the same-find the bad guys. Stop them.
