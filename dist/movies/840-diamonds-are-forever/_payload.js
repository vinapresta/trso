Through an examination of Fleming's Jamaica-set novels Live and Let Die, Dr. No, and The Man with the Golden Gun, as well as the later film adaptations of these novels, Ian Kinane reveals Fleming's deep ambivalence to British decolonisation and to wider Anglo-Caribbean relations. Offered here is a crucial insight into the public imagination during the birth of modern British multiculturalism that encompasses broader links between Fleming's writings on race and the representation of early British-Jamaican cultural relations. By exploring the effects of racial representation in these popular works, Kinane connects the novels to more contemporary concerns regarding migration and the ways in which the misrepresentation of cultures, races, and peoples has led to fraught and contentious global geo-political relations as figured in the fictional icon, James Bond.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=udEhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:["Ian Kinane"],firstBook:c,published:"2021-04-08",publisher:"Bloomsbury Publishing",subtitle:a}},{id:5191,attributes:{title:"Blood on the Stone",description:"Africa's diamond wars took four million lives.

Two hooded men entered the room and sat opposite the secret agent. They put down football boots beside them and started to unlace their shoes. Spang spoke again. “We’ll make it a Brooklyn stomping. Eighty per center. Okay with you...Mr. Bond?” The Spangled Mob hires undercover agent James Bond to smuggle diamonds into America, and the ace British spy finds himself partners in crime with the most tantalizing female he’s ever encountered—Tiffany Case, hotter than stolen “ice,” as surprising as sudden death.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=KfIwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2017-07-11","Pickle Partners Publishing"))
