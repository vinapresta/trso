Raised in the ghost town of Silver Wells, Nevada, Maria Wyeth is an ex-model and the star of two films directed by her estranged husband, Carter Lang. But in the spiritual desert of 1960s Los Angeles, Maria has lost the plot of her own life.

With a forward by Hilton Als, these twelve pieces from 1968 to 2000, never before gathered together, offer an illuminating glimpse into the mind and process of a legendary figure. They showcase Joan Didion&#39;s incisive reporting, her empathetic gaze, and her role as &quot;an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time&quot; (The New York Times Book Review). Here, Didion touches on topics ranging from newspapers (&quot;the problem is not so much whether one trusts the news as to whether one finds it&quot;), to the fantasy of San Simeon, to not getting into Stanford. In &quot;Why I Write,&quot; Didion ponders the act of writing: &quot;I write entirely to find out what I&#39;m thinking, what I&#39;m looking at, what I see and what it means.&quot; From her admiration for Hemingway&#39;s sentences to her acknowledgment that Martha Stewart&#39;s story is one &quot;that has historically encouraged women in this country, even as it has threatened men,&quot; these essays are acutely and brilliantly observed. Each piece is classic Didion: incisive, bemused, and stunningly prescient.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQzMzViMTUtYjFlOS00MDBiLThiNjctOTNkMTY5NDhlYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Play It As It Lays" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Play It As It Lays is based on the book Play It as It Lays? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">Maria Wyeth, an ex-model and B-movie actress, strolls on the grounds of a mental hospital, recalling the traumatic events which led to her breakdown.
