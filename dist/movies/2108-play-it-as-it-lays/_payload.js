With a forward by Hilton Als, these twelve pieces from 1968 to 2000, never before gathered together, offer an illuminating glimpse into the mind and process of a legendary figure. They showcase Joan Didion's incisive reporting, her empathetic gaze, and her role as \"an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time\" (The New York Times Book Review). Here, Didion touches on topics ranging from newspapers (\"the problem is not so much whether one trusts the news as to whether one finds it\"), to the fantasy of San Simeon, to not getting into Stanford. In \"Why I Write,\" Didion ponders the act of writing: \"I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means.\" From her admiration for Hemingway's sentences to her acknowledgment that Martha Stewart's story is one \"that has historically encouraged women in this country, even as it has threatened men,\" these essays are acutely and brilliantly observed. Each piece is classic Didion: incisive, bemused, and stunningly prescient.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-RDfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:d,published:"2021-01-26",publisher:"Vintage",subtitle:b}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681377252387}}("Joan Didion","","movie",null,"series",1,"Play It as It Lays","A “scathing novel” of one woman’s path of self-destruction in 1960s Hollywood—by the New York Times–bestselling author of The White Album (The Washington Post Book World). Spare, elegant, and terrifying, Play It as It Lays is the unforgettable story of a woman and a society come undone. Raised in the ghost town of Silver Wells, Nevada, Maria Wyeth is an ex-model and the star of two films directed by her estranged husband, Carter Lang. But in the spiritual desert of 1960s Los Angeles, Maria has lost the plot of her own life. Her daughter, Kate, was born with an “aberrant chemical in her brain.” Her long-troubled marriage has slipped beyond repair, and her disastrous love affairs and strained friendships provide little comfort. Her only escape is to get in her car and drive the freeway—in the fast lane with the radio turned up high—until it runs out “somewhere no place at all where the flawless burning concrete just stopped.” But every ride to nowhere, every sleepless night numbed by pills and booze and sex, makes it harder for Maria to find the meaning in another day. Told with profound economy of style and a “vision as bleak and precise as Eliot’s in ‘The Wasteland’,” Play It as It Lays ruthlessly dissects the dark heart of the American dream (The New York Times). It is a searing masterpiece “from one of the very few writers of our time who approaches her terrible subject with absolute seriousness, with fear and humility and awe” (Joyce Carol Oates, The New York Times Book Review).","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=OEDFDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2017-05-09","Open Road Media","A Novel"))
