The reckless pilot Rosie takes him to the wilderness and he is left alone with his supply in an extremely cold spot. He is saved by the local Ootek that is traveling with his dog sledding. He builds a shelter for Tyler and organizes his supplies. Tyler finds two wolves that he calls George and Angeline and their three offspring and he examines his excrement to learn what they eat. Soon he discovers that the wolves eat only mice and Tyler decides to do the same to prove to the government that the wolves do not eat caribous. Ootek returns with his friend Mike that speaks English and translates what Ootek say. The trio stays together and Tyler learns that Mike is a hunter. Mike travels with Ootek by canoe to see a herd of caribou that is attacked by a pack of wolves. Tyler examines the bones and finds that the animal was diseased, proving that the wolves are responsible for keeping the caribou strong as told by Ootek. Tyler finds Rosie with two hunters planning to explore the area with tourism and Tyler has an argument with the pilot and returns to the camp. He finds the three offspring but the wolves are missing.

Hordes of bloodthirsty wolves are slaughtering the arctic caribou, and the government's Wildlife Service assigns naturalist Farley Mowat to investigate. Mowat is dropped alone onto the frozen tundra, where he begins his mission to live among the howling wolf packs and study their ways. Contact with his quarry comes quickly, and Mowat discovers not a den of marauding killers but a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. As Mowat comes closer to the wolf world, he comes to fear with them the onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators out to erase the noble wolf community from the Arctic.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=iOQHvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:true,published:"2016-10-18",publisher:"Emblem Editions",subtitle:"Penguin Modern Classics Edition"}},{id:9413,attributes:{title:b,description:"This international bestseller that changed the way we look at wolves “opens new horizons in understanding animal nature and intelligence” (Newsday). In 1948, Farley Mowat landed in the far north of Manitoba, Canada, a young biologist sent to investigate the region’s dwindling population of caribou. Many people thought that the caribous’ conspicuous decline had been caused by the tundra’s most notorious predator: the wolf. Alone among the howling canine packs, Mowat expected to find the bloodthirsty beasts of popular conception. Instead, over the course of a summer spent observing the powerful animals, Mowat discovered an animal species with a remarkable capacity for loyalty, virtue, and playfulness. Praised for its humor and engrossing narrative, Never Cry Wolf describes a group of wolves whose interactions and behaviors seem strikingly similar to our own. Mowat humanizes these animals that have long been demonized, turning the widespread narrative of the “savage wolf” on its head and inspiring many governments to enact protective legislation for the North’s most mysterious creature.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=wyTfCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2015-08-04",publisher:"Open Road Media",subtitle:a}},{id:9414,attributes:{title:b,description:"The classic of nature writing--the spellbinding story of adventures among arctic wolves--is now available in a new paperback edition.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WphFrR_Nu9YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1973-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:9415,attributes:{title:"CLASSICS Never Cry Wolf",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1000-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}},{id:9416,attributes:{title:b,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CQLsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:["Curtis Hanson","Jay Presson Allen"],firstBook:d,published:"1988-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"Second Draft Screenplay"}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940955713}}("","Never Cry Wolf","Farley Mowat",null))
