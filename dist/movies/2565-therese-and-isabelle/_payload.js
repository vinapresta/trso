While strolling about the deserted grounds and classrooms she remembers her highly emotional experiences there, and well-executed flashbacks occur to her youth. At 17 she is abandoned by her loving mother because of remarriage and left at a European boarding school, disenchanted and lonely. Immediately she meets Isabell, an older, confident, rebellious girl. The two develop a friendship quickly without much conversation or bonding, but have the always temporary chemistry necessary for their friendship to progress into a sexual relationship. The sex scenes are slow and sensual -as they should be for two young girls experiencing lesbianism for the first time. Despite their undying love confessions to each other, Theresa wakes up one morning to find Isabell has left the school, her room and desk replaced with another student.

With this startling new translation of Leduc’s hidden classic, the groundbreaking Thérèse and Isabelle proves an authentic and liberating exploration of queer sensibilities, which still stands as “one of the greatest examples of French-Language erotic literature” ever written (Times Literary Supplement). Censored for half a century for its vivid depiction of budding female sexuality, this is the “dark and luminous” (Nicole Borssard) novel of two young women in the consuming and at times frightening throes of first love. Navigating their schoolgirl relationship becomes a rapturous secret, as they sneak away from repressive boundaries to go beyond the limits of friendship with “all the raw urgency of female adolescent sexuality: its energy and intensity, the push-pull of excitement, its dangers and glories” (Kate Millett, award-winning author of Sexual Politics and Mother Millett). Filmed in 1968 by Radley Metzger, starring Essy Persson and Anna Gaël, Thérèse and Isabelle is finally available as it was intended to be read. “I have waited a very long time to slip back into the unexpurgated, delicious darkness with these iconic lesbian lovers” (Amber Dawn, Lambda Literary Award-winning author Sodom Road Exit).",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DNVECQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"2015-06-08",publisher:"The Feminist Press at CUNY",subtitle:a}},{id:12333,attributes:{title:g,description:"\"Thérèse and Isabelle is the tale of two boarding school girls in love.
