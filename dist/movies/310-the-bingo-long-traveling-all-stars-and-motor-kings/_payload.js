They take to the road, barnstorming through small Midwestern towns, playing the local teams to make ends meet. One of the opposing players, 'Esquire' Joe Calloway (Stan Shaw), is so good that they recruit him. Bingo's team becomes so outlandishly entertaining and successful, it begins to cut into the attendance of the established Negro League teams. Finally, Bingo's nemesis Potter is forced to propose a winner-take-all game: if Bingo's team can beat a bunch of all-stars, it can join the league, but if it loses, the players will return to their old teams. Potter has two of his goons kidnap Leon prior to the game as insurance, but he escapes and is key to his side's victory. As it turns out, there is a major league scout in the audience. After the game, he offers Esquire Joe the chance to break the color barrier; with Bingo's blessing, he accepts. Leon glumly foresees the decline of the Negro League as more players follow Esquire Joe's lead, but Bingo, ever the optimist, cheers him up by describing the wild promotional stunts he intends to stage to bring in the paying customers.",slug:"the-bingo-long-traveling-all-stars-and-motor-kings"}}},books:{data:[{id:3013,attributes:{title:d,description:h,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=xotnZsWw0K0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[e],firstBook:true,published:"1993-01-01",publisher:"University of Illinois Press",subtitle:a}},{id:3014,attributes:{title:"The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings",description:h,thumbnail:a,authors:[e],firstBook:c,published:"1976-08-03",publisher:"Signet Book",subtitle:a}},{id:3015,attributes:{title:"Ebony",description:"EBONY is the flagship magazine of Johnson Publishing.

William Brashler's novel is the story of a black barnstorming ball club in 1939, before Jackie Robinson broke baseball's unofficial color barrier. It was made into a popular film in 1976 that starred James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams, and Richard Pryor. This edition includes a new preface by the author and an introduction by Peter Bjarkman that sets the novel in the context both of scholarly literature on the Negro Baseball Leagues and of sports fiction."))
