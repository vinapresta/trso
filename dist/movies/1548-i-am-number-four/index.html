Now all of that has changed. The invasion has begun. The Garde are stretched thin, fighting this war on many fronts. The only chance they have is to take out the Mogadorian leader once and for all—but his fate is now irrevocably tied with Ella&#39;s. They can&#39;t destroy one without the other. But if the Garde can&#39;t find another way to stop the Mogs, humanity will suffer the same fate as the Loric: annihilation.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb8121"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=9pRVCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book I Am Number Four: The Beginning: Books 1-3 Collection" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>I Am Number Four: The Beginning: Books 1-3 Collection</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Pittacus Lore<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by HarperCollins</span><span><span> - </span>9/1/2015</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>The first three novels in the bestselling Lorien Legacies series that began with I Am Number Four are included in this collection: I Am Number Four: The book that started it all . . .

He wanted to search the facility for anything that might help John Smith and the others stop the alien invasion. But once the spaceships descended, that plan went up in smoke.
