Never before have readers been able to sample 10 blockbuster works of Mary Higgins Clark in one package. Delve into fan favorites, such as Where Are The Children, Daddy&#39;s Little Girl, All Around the Town, and Pretend You Don&#39;t See Her, plus an extended teaser of her new mystery thriller, Daddy&#39;s Gone A Hunting. Each excerpt comes with an original introduction by the author explaining the inspiration for the book. In her latest novel, Mary Higgins Clark exposes a dark secret from a family’s past that threatens the lives of two sisters, Kate and Hannah Connelly, when the family-owned furniture firm in Long Island City, founded by their grandfather and famous for its fine reproductions of antiques, explodes into flames in the middle of the night, leveling the buildings to the ground, including the museum where priceless antiques have been on permanent display for years. The ashes reveal a startling and grisly discovery and provoke a host of suspicions and questions. Was the explosion deliberately set? What was Kate—tall, gorgeous, blond, a CPA for one of the biggest accounting firms in the country, and sister of a rising fashion designer—doing in the museum when it burst into flames? Why was Gus, a retired and disgruntled craftsman, with her at that time of night? Now Gus is dead, and Kate lies in the hospital badly injured and in a coma, so neither can tell what drew them there, or what the tragedy may have to do with the hunt for a young woman missing for many years, nor can they warn that somebody may be covering his tracks, willing to kill to save himself.</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><div class="my-2 w-full" id="bookThumb11456"><div class="mb-2 p-4 border border-trso-blue"><div class="disabled flex flex-wrap items-center"><img src="https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1-A3HKo57p4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api" alt="Cover of the book All Through The Night" class="w-1/4 w-auto w-auto h-24"><div class="pl-2 sm:pl-4 md:pl-8 pr-0 sm:pr-4 md:pr-8 w-3/4 md:w-auto"><h3 class="text-white text-base md:text-lg"><span>All Through The Night</span></h3><p class="text-sm md:text-base"><span>written by</span><!--[--><span><!---->Mary Higgins Clark<!----></span><!--]--></p><p class="text-xs md:sm"><span>Published by Simon and Schuster</span><span><span> - </span>12/11/2012</span></p></div></div><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p>At the heart of the novel are two of Mary Higgins Clark&#39;s most loved characters: Alvirah, the lottery winner turned amateur sleuth, and her husband, Willy, who are caught up in a Christmas mystery that calls on all of their skills and experience. Willy has been looking forward to playing Santa at the after-school centre recently set up to care for the children of working parents on New York&#39;s Upper West Side, and Alvirah has been busy with rehearsals for the Christmas pageant. But suddenly a shadow falls upon the Christmas cheer.

Television journalist Delaney Wright is on the brink of stardom when she begins covering a sensational murder trial. She should be thrilled with the story of her career, but her growing desire to locate her birth mother consumes her thoughts. When Delaney’s friends Alvirah Meehan and her husband Willy offer to look into the mystery surrounding her birth, they uncover a shocking secret they do not want to reveal. On trial for murder is Betsy Grant, widow of a wealthy doctor who has suffered from Alzheimer’s for eight years. When her once-upon-a-time celebrity lawyer urges her to accept a plea bargain, Betsy refuses: she will go to trial to prove her innocence. Betsy’s stepson, Alan Grant, bides his time nervously as the trial begins. His substantial inheritance hangs in the balance—his only means of making good on payments he owes his ex-wife, his children, and increasingly angry creditors. As the trial unfolds and the damning evidence against Betsy piles up, Delaney is convinced that Betsy is not guilty and frantically tries to prove her innocence. A true classic from Mary Higgins Clark, As Time Goes By is a thrilling read by “the mistress of high tension” (The New Yorker).</p><!--]--></div><!----></div></div></div><!--]--></div></section><div class="flex flex-wrap"><div class="sm:w-1/6 py-2 mx-auto lg:pr-4"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY2Y2RkMmUtZTBkNi00OWVlLWI0YTYtZjRhOThhNGEyNjUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMwOTY2NTI@._V1_SX300.jpg" alt="Poster Where Are the Children?" class="inline-block"></div><div class="sm:w-5/6 py-2"><span class="block font-bold mb-2 text-center lg:text-justify">Did you know that the movie Where Are the Children? is based on the book Where Are The Children?? </span><div><div class="text-justify pb-2 text-sm lg:text-base relative transition-all duration-500 ease before:transition-all before:duration-500 before:ease"><!--[--><p itemProp="description">On her birthday, San Francisco resident Nancy Harmon&#39;s two kids Peter and Lisa disappear, later to be found dead. The police wrongfully accuse a devastated Nancy of being the killer. Nancy is found guilty and sentenced to the gas chamber, but her attorney manages to get her conviction overturned. Much to the District Attorney&#39;s dismay, Nancy can&#39;t be put back on trial because key witness Rob Legler has left the country. And Nancy&#39;s husband, college professor Carl Harmon, commits suicide. Seven years later, Nancy has relocated to a town in Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Nancy has changed her identity, re-colored her hair, and has married a realtor named Ray Eldridge, with whom she has two kids named Michael and Missy, and the terrible pain from what happened to Peter and Lisa has begun to heal. But today is Nancy&#39;s birthday. She has allowed Michael and Missy to go out to play in the back yard. Nancy opens the newspaper and is stunned to find, in the local section of the paper, her picture and all of the details of the murders of Peter and Lisa. Nancy rushes out to the back yard to get Michael and Missy and bring them back into the house, but Nancy finds only one of Missy&#39;s red mittens...and Nancy knows that the nightmare is beginning again. Because of the disappearance and murder of Peter and Lisa, Nancy is understandably concerned about finding Mike and Missy before they are hurt the way Peter and Lisa were. Local police chief Jed Coffin, who has read the newspaper, wrongfully sees Nancy as a suspect in the disappearance of Michael and Missy. When people in the town read about Nancy in the newspaper, virtually everyone suspects her of murdering Mike and Missy. But Mike and Missy have been kidnapped by a man named Courtney Parrish. In the desperate search for Mike and Missy, everyone will discover the devastating truth as to who Courtney Parrish really is. And there is also another question -- was it Parrish who killed Peter and Lisa years ago?</p><!--]--></div><!----></div><ul class="py-8 text-sm lg:text-base"><!--[--><li><span class="italic pb-2">Internet Movie Database:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">5.7/10</span></li><li><span class="italic pb-2">Rotten Tomatoes:</span>  <span class="text-trso-blue font-semibold">33%</span></li><!--]--></ul></div></div><div><h2 class="mb-4 font-bold text-base lg:text-lg text-center lg:text-justify"><span>Do you want to have more information about Where Are The Children?, or tell what you think about the book adaptation?
