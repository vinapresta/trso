Well-mannered, always bright, smiling and positive, conservative but with a liberal edge, what bad could ever happen to him?

In American Pastoral (1997), Swede Levov is wrenched from the tranquility of his domestic life and into the turbulent 1960s by his cherished daughter, an antiwar terrorist. I Married a Communist (1998), a story of betrayal set in America's anti-Communist 1940s, recounts the rise and fall of radio star Ira Ringold, exposed by his wife as \"an American taking his orders from Moscow.\" The Human Stain (2000) is set in 1998, when America is whipped into a frenzy of prurience by the impeachment of a president; in a small New England college town an aging classics professor, Coleman Silk, is forced to retire when his colleagues decree that he is a racist. The charge is a lie, but the real truth about Silk would astonish his most virulent accuser. Philip Roth is the only living novelist whose works are being collected in the Library of America series. The nine-volume edition will be completed in 2013, for Roth's 80th birthday. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing.
