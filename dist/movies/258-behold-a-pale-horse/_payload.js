His fellow lodgers believe that he, like them, came to England to flee Hitler. But the outwardly poised Herr Braun is inwardly a very anxious man, wracked especially by newspaper reports of the ongoing hunt for Nazi war criminals. The Glass Pearls (1966) was the second novel by Emeric Pressburger, who, with Michael Powell, created such cinematic masterworks as A Matter of Life and Death and The Red Shoes. Likely inspired by the capture of Adolf Eichmann, it is a gripping psychological study of a cultured man, guilty of unspeakable crimes, trying to hide in plain sight. This new edition includes two new introductions, by cinema scholar Caitlin McDonald and by Pressburger's grandson, the Oscar-winning film director Kevin Macdonald.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=12BfBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"2015-04-16",publisher:"Faber & Faber",subtitle:a}},{id:2814,attributes:{title:i,description:a,thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=HFlNAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[c],firstBook:d,published:"1964-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:a}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1681309141909}}("","movie","Emeric Pressburger",null,"Killing a Mouse on Sunday","1963-01-01","series",1,"Behold a Pale Horse","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=SwY9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","Drawings by Papas"))
