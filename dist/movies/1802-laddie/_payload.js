Font adjustments & biography included Unabridged (100% Original content) Illustrated About Laddie: A True Blue Story by Gene Stratton-Porter Loosely based on Stratton-Porter's own childhood, Laddie is a double tale -- the classic poor-boy\u002Frich-girl romance and the story of a child of nature and her idyllic childhood. This is the delightful story of a loving family narrated from the perspective of the \"Little Sister.\" The story was published in 1913 and probably takes place in the mid to late 1800's. We get to appreciate Little Sister's love of the land, the birds, her family and particularly her love and devotion to her oldest brother and hero, Laddie. While we enjoy seeing how a loving family associates, disciplines, and cares for one another with a love and belief of God and the Savior, we also see some contrasting views of a family whose father has forsaken God and the poison he carries while holding a long grudge.",thumbnail:e,authors:["Gene Gene Stratton-Porter"],firstBook:f,published:"2017-04-24",publisher:e,subtitle:"By Gene Stratton-Porter - Illustrated"}},{id:9173,attributes:{title:c,description:"\"Have I got a Little Sister anywhere in this house?\" inquired Laddie at the door, in his most coaxing voice. \"Yes sir,\" I answered, dropping the trousers I was making for Hezekiah, my pet bluejay, and running as fast as I could.
