They certainly didn't realize that a seemingly meek Greek college student by the name of Elektra would become one of the most popular and memorable characters in the post-modern, increasingly adult world of comic books. Telling the story of how the death of her father drove an innocent, naive college student into a deadly trained martial arts assassin, this seminal work stands alone among the great stories to ever be produced in the graphic storytelling medium. Elektra became so popular, in fact, that even after her death, interest in the character was so high that a yearlong, multi-part epic was created entirely for her. Elektra: Assassin was immediately recognized as being like nothing that had come before. The fragmented, complex script by Miller was both dramatically compelling and darkly satirical.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=t3KpQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b,"Bill Sienkiewicz"],firstBook:d,published:"1987-01-01",publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:5670,attributes:{title:"Elektra Lives Again",description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b,"Lynn Varley"],firstBook:d,published:"1990-01-01",publisher:h,subtitle:a}},{id:5671,attributes:{title:"Frank Miller's Sin City: Hard Goodbye Curator's Collection",description:"This is the ULTIMATE edition of Sin City for your library.
