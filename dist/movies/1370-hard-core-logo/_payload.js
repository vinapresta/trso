However, whether or not this film was ever \"made\" is debatable. And only one print is said to exist. Nevertheless, American Whiskey Bar, a film seen by only a handful of people, is well on its way to becoming a curious footnote to cinematic history. American Whiskey Bar, the book, is an attempt to set the record straight--a story of sex, violence, lies, ambition, power, paradox, dreams, and regret. Consider yourself warned. First published in Canada in 1997, this new edition, which features a foreword by William Gibson (Neuromancer, Pattern Recognition), is the first edition ever available in the U.S. Praise for American Whiskey Bar: \"Tightly packed . . . the book weaves its way in and out of various levels of reality. . . . There's a bright, playful mind at work here.\"--Toronto Star \"Turner constructs an intense, intelligent, and darkly humorous satire. . . . Too original to be nominated for awards.\"--Quill & Quire \"Brilliant . . . a dazzling, dizzying multilayered blend of fact and fiction, of the plausible and the preposterous, of the real and the hyper-real. It is also screamingly funny.\"--Globe & Mail Globe & Mail Notable Book, 1997 Quill & Quire Best Book of 1997 Coolest Canadian Book of the Year, Chapters Michael Turner lives in Vancouver, where, in addition to books and screenplays, he writes art essays and edits ArsenalAdvance, a literary\u002Fvisual art imprint.

Together Nettie and the narrator find in film a means of expressing their somewhat skewed world views. At the age of sixteen the narrator shoots his first adult film, surreptitiously capturing his neighbours having sex. He believes that through representations of sexual activity he can comment on that which he finds both painful and confusing. Nettie, an idealistic poet now away at school, sees in pornography the opportunity to do something artistic, liberating, and socially relevant, and she pushes the narrator to make films that subvert the way the world is constructed. Ultimately, despite his radical intentions, the narrator falls into a world of greed, delusion, and hypocrisy - the same world he once rebelled against.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=n1d0qIs7vjsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","2011-02-04","Vintage Canada"))
