His next victim apparently is Helen, a mute girl working as a maid for the wealthy, bedridden Mrs. Warren. Mrs. Warren urges her to leave the house, as does Dr. Parry, who knows the reason for Helen's loss of speech and hopes to help her get her voice back. Fear Stalks the Village: Series of poison pen letters cause panic in a small, quiet English village and soon after, the murders start happening. As the fear arises, Joan Brooks, who used to live a peaceful life, is forced to act fast in order to save the lives of her loved ones and her own. She Faded into Air: The story of the alleged disappearance of Evelyn Cross was too fantastic for credence. According to the available evidence, she melted into thin air shortly after four o'clock on a foggy afternoon in late October. One minute, she was visible in the flesh--a fashionable blonde, nineteen years of age and weighing about eight and a half stone. The next minute, she was gone. The Wheel Spins: Miss Loveapple has always had an unusual belief in her incredible luck. However, her luck is about to run out when she becomes a target of a cruel serial killer. Unaware of the danger, she goes through a number of insane situations escaping the death by a mere wonder. How long will she last?
