Abandoning her studies at Oxford in 1915 to enlist as a nurse in the armed services, Brittain served in London, in Malta, and on the Western Front. By war's end she had lost virtually everyone she loved. \"Testament of Youth\" is both a record of what she lived through and an elegy for a vanished generation. Hailed by the \"Times Literary Supplement\" as a book that helped \"both form and define the mood of its time,\" it speaks to any generation that has been irrevocably changed by war.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JaOYsyWKVdMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",authors:[b],firstBook:true,published:"1989-01-01",publisher:"Penguin Group",subtitle:f}},{id:12254,attributes:{title:c,description:"In 1915 Vera Brittain abandoned her studies at Oxford to enroll as a volunteer nurse with the armed forces. She served in London, Malta, and on the Western Front in France, witnessing the destruction and suffering of the fighting at first hand. By 1918, her life--like so many of her generation--had changed beyond recognition. Testament of Youth, one of the most famous memoirs of the First World War, is Brittain's account of how she survived those agonising years; how she lost the man she loved; how she nursed the wounded and how she emerged into an altered world. A passionate protest against war and an evocative portrait of a lost generation, it made Vera Brittain one of the best-loved writers of her time, and has lost none of its power to shock, move and enthrall readers since its first publication in 1933. -- Jacket.",thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"2009-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:f}},{id:12255,attributes:{title:c,description:a,thumbnail:a,authors:[b],firstBook:d,published:"1935-01-01",publisher:a,subtitle:"An Autobiographical Study of the Years 1900-1925, by Vera Brittain"}},{id:12256,attributes:{title:c,description:"Vera Mary Brittain (29 December 1893 â€“ 29 March 1970) was an English Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse, writer, feminist, socialist, and pacifist.
