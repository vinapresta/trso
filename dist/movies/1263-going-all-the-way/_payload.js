When his older brother, Roy, joins the US Marines, Artie is left to defend the home front—as well as Roy’s high school sweetheart, Shirley. Without the guidance of his beloved big brother, Artie resorts to reading advice in Collier’s on how to identify spies and search for German aircraft over the lush fields of Illinois. As Artie works to protect Shirley—a lost cause, despite the cheerleader’s best efforts—he must come to grips with his own burgeoning sexuality as he steps cautiously toward adulthood. Rendered in stunning, peeled-back prose, Under the Apple Tree realistically depicts one boy’s loss of innocence and the devastating effects of war felt far beyond the battlefield.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=WmVBCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:b,publisher:c,subtitle:d}},{id:6958,attributes:{title:"Home Free",description:"A slacker hero embarks on a rollicking cross-country journey of love-ins and acid trips in this rich portrait of the 1960s When his foxy professor\u002Fgirlfriend kicks him out of her apartment, perennial college student Gene Barrett sets off on a road trip in search of a place he can call home. He ventures from Boston to Maine to Iowa City, ultimately making his way to the “last resort” of California’s Venice Beach. Experimenting with LSD, hash, and heroin, and encountering rock stars, draft dodgers, and natural food store proprietors living off the land, Gene zigzags through a cross-section of 1960s American counterculture. More than a freewheeling jaunt through the sixties, though, Home Free sheds light on the universal desire for love and belonging. Amidst the haze of drugs and free-loving hippies, Gene is forced to look inward and face his deeply human flaws—because eventually, his life will depend on it. With national bestselling author Dan Wakefield’s trademark fusion of gritty, journalistic prose and richly evocative language, Gene’s story is an engaging, somber meditation on self-awareness, responsibility, and growing up.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=DWRBCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:b,publisher:c,subtitle:d}},{id:6959,attributes:{title:"Starting Over",description:"The comic national bestseller of love and loss set amid the sexual revolution of the 1970s When Phil Potter decides to divorce his wife, Jessica, after a few difficult years, he imagines he’s in for a wild jaunt through the sexually liberated 1970s. But his new start—Phil has also left behind his job in PR for a teaching gig at a junior college—is more solitary drinking and TV dinners than raucous orgies. Even the women he does manage to connect with are equally disaffected with their own divorces or failing marriages, and Phil begins to understand the harsh, though often darkly funny, realities of starting over and searching for love the second time around. Capturing both the excitement and struggles of feminism and the sexual revolution, Starting Over depicts the pleasures and pitfalls of dating in the seventies with humor and a deep understanding of how relationships work—or, more commonly, don’t work. Replete with spot-on cultural references and rendered under Wakefield’s careful journalistic eye, Starting Over is a stunning reminder of the hardships of love in the modern age.",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=UWJBCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",authors:[a],firstBook:e,published:b,publisher:c,subtitle:d}}]}}},meta:{}}},prerenderedAt:1680940978399}}("Dan Wakefield","2016-02-09","Open Road Media","A Novel",null,"Going All the Way","Two friends return home from the Korean War to find their world—and themselves—irrevocably altered in this novel hailed by Kurt Vonnegut as “gruesomely accurate and enchanting” and “wildly sexy” Willard “Sonny” Burns and Tom “Gunner” Casselman, Korean War vets and former classmates, reunite on the train ride home to Indianapolis. Despite their shared history, the two young men could not be more different: Sonny had been an introverted, bookish student, whereas Gunner had been the consummate Casanova and athlete—and a popular source of macho pride throughout the high school. Reunited by the pains of war, they go in search of finding love, rebuilding their lives, and shedding the repressive expectations of their families. As Sonny and Gunner seek their true passions, the stage is set for a wounded, gripping account of disillusionment and self-discovery as seen through the lens of the conservative Midwest in the summer of 1954. Rendered in honest prose, national bestseller Going All the Way expertly and astutely captures the joys and struggles of working-class Middle America, and the risks of challenging the status quo. Author Dan Wakefield crafts this enduring coming-of-age tale with fluidity, grace, and deep humanity.","https:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=eWNBCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"))
